In computing a hash table hash map is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type a structure that can map keys to values A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index also called a hash code into an array of buckets or slots from which the desired value can be found During lookup the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored Ideally the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function which might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key Such collisions are typically accommodated in some way In a welldimensioned hash table the average cost number of instructions for each lookup is independent of the number of elements stored in the table Many hash table designs also allow arbitrary insertions and deletions of keyvalue pairs at amortized constant average cost per operation In many situations hash tables turn out to be on average more efficient than search trees or any other table lookup structure For this reason they are widely used in many kinds of computer software particularly for associative arrays database indexing caches and sets A basic requirement is that the function should provide a uniform distribution of hash values A nonuniform distribution increases the number of collisions and the cost of resolving them Uniformity is sometimes difficult to ensure by design but may be evaluated empirically using statistical tests eg a Pearsons chisquared test for discrete uniform distributions The distribution needs to be uniform only for table sizes that occur in the application In particular if one uses dynamic resizing with exact doubling and halving of the table size then the hash function needs to be uniform only when the size is a power of two Here the index can be computed as some range of bits of the hash function On the other hand some hashing algorithms prefer to have the size be a prime number The modulus operation may provide some additional mixing this is especially useful with a poor hash function For open addressing schemes the hash function should also avoid clustering the mapping of two or more keys to consecutive slots Such clustering may cause the lookup cost to skyrocket even if the load factor is low and collisions are infrequent The popular multiplicative hash3 is claimed to have particularly poor clustering behavior Cryptographic hash functions are believed to provide good hash functions for any table size either by modulo reduction or by bit masking They may also be appropriate if there is a risk of malicious users trying to sabotage a network service by submitting requests designed to generate a large number of collisions in the servers hash tables However the risk of sabotage can also be avoided by cheaper methods such as applying a secret salt to the data A drawback of cryptographic hashing functions is that they are often slower to compute which means that in cases where the uniformity for any size is not necessary a noncryptographic hashing function might be preferablecitation needed Kindependent hashing offers a way to prove a certain hash function doesnt have bad keysets for a given type of hashtable A number of such results are known for collision resolution schemes such as linear probing and cuckoo hashing Since Kindependence can prove a hash function works one can then focus on finding the fastest possible such hash function Although operations on a hash table take constant time on average the cost of a good hash function can be significantly higher than the inner loop of the lookup algorithm for a sequential list or search tree Thus hash tables are not effective when the number of entries is very small However in some cases the high cost of computing the hash function can be mitigated by saving the hash value together with the key For certain string processing applications such as spellchecking hash tables may be less efficient than tries finite automata or Judy arrays Also if there are not too many possible keys to storethat is if each key can be represented by a small enough number of bitsthen instead of a hash table one may use the key directly as the index into an array of values Note that there are no collisions in this case The entries stored in a hash table can be enumerated efficiently at constant cost per entry but only in some pseudorandom order Therefore there is no efficient way to locate an entry whose key is nearest to a given key Listing all n entries in some specific order generally requires a separate sorting step whose cost is proportional to logn per entry In comparison ordered search trees have lookup and insertion cost proportional to logn but allow finding the nearest key at about the same cost and ordered enumeration of all entries at constant cost per entry However a LinkingHashMap can be made to create a hash table with a nonrandom sequence If the keys are not stored because the hash function is collisionfree there may be no easy way to enumerate the keys that are present in the table at any given moment Although the average cost per operation is constant and fairly small the cost of a single operation may be quite high In particular if the hash table uses dynamic resizing an insertion or deletion operation may occasionally take time proportional to the number of entries This may be a serious drawback in realtime or interactive applications Hash tables in general exhibit poor locality of referencethat is the data to be accessed is distributed seemingly at random in memory Because hash tables cause access patterns that jump around this can trigger microprocessor cache misses that cause long delays Compact data structures such as arrays searched with linear search may be faster if the table is relatively small and keys are compact The optimal performance point varies from system to system Hash tables become quite inefficient when there are many collisions While extremely uneven hash distributions are extremely unlikely to arise by chance a malicious adversary with knowledge of the hash function may be able to supply information to a hash that creates worstcase behavior by causing excessive collisions resulting in very poor performance eg a denial of service attack In critical applications a data structure with better worstcase guarantees can be used however universal hashing or a keyed hash function both of which prevents the attacker from predicting which inputs cause worstcase behavior may be preferable The hash function used by the hash table in the Linux routing table cache was changed with Linux version as a countermeasure against such attacks The ad hoc shortkeyed hash construction was later updated to use a jhash and then SipHash Anarchoprimitivism is a political ideology that advocates a return to noncivilized ways of life through deindustrialization abolition of the division of labor or specialization and abandonment of largescale organization technologies Anarchoprimitivists critique the origins and progress of the Industrial Revolution and industrial society According to anarchoprimitivism the shift from huntergatherer to agricultural subsistence during the Neolithic Revolution gave rise to coercion social alienation and social stratification Many classical anarchists reject the critique of civilization while some such as Wolfi Landstreicher endorse the critique without considering themselves anarchoprimitivists Anarchoprimitivists are distinguished by the focus on the praxis of achieving a feral state of being through rewilding During the French Revolution partisan groups such as the Enragés and the sansculottes saw a turning point in the fermentation of antistate and federalist sentiments34 The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as William Godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in England morally delegitimising the state Max Stirners thinking paved the way to individualism and PierreJoseph Proudhons theory of mutualism found fertile soil in France35 By the late 1870s various anarchist schools of thought had become welldefined and a wave of then unprecedented globalisation occurred from 1880 to 191436 This era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the Spanish Civil War and is considered the golden age of anarchism35Drawing from mutualism Mikhail Bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the International Workingmens Association a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents The International became a significant political force with Karl Marx being a leading figure and a member of its General Council Bakunins faction the Jura Federation and Proudhons followers the mutualists opposed state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings37 After bitter disputes the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the Marxists at the 1872 Hague Congress38 Anarchists were treated similarly in the Second International being ultimately expelled in 189639 Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marxs terms they would end up the new tyrants of workers In response to their expulsion from the First International anarchists formed the St Imier International Under the influence of Peter Kropotkin a Russian philosopher and scientist anarchocommunism overlapped with collectivism40 Anarchocommunists who drew inspiration from the 1871 Paris Commune advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to ones needs41 At the turn of the century anarchism had spread all over the world42 It was a notable feature of the international syndicalism movement43 In China small groups of students imported the humanistic proscience version of anarchocommunism44 Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east travelling to the Japanese capital to study45 In Latin America Argentina was a stronghold for anarchosyndicalism where it became the most prominent leftwing ideology46 During this time a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence This strategy became known as propaganda of the deed47 The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many Communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts48 Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to exclude them from American immigration including the Immigration Act of 1903 also called the Anarchist Exclusion Act49 Illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period50 Despite concerns anarchists enthusiastically participated in the Russian Revolution in opposition to the White movement however they met harsh suppression after the Bolshevik government was stabilised Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine51 notably leading to the Kronstadt rebellion and Nestor Makhnos struggle in the Free Territory With the anarchists being crushed in Russia two new antithetical currents emerged namely platformism and synthesis anarchism The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party Seeing the victories of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements In France and the United States members of major syndicalist movements such as the General Confederation of Labour and the Industrial Workers of the World left their organisations and joined the Communist International52 In the Spanish Civil War of 1936 anarchists and syndicalists CNT and FAI once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists A long tradition of Spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war In response to the army rebellion an anarchistinspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land53 The Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named May Days as Joseph Stalin tried to seize control of the Republicans54 At the end of World War II the anarchist movement was severely weakened55 The 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of MarxismLeninism and tensions built by the Cold War56 During this time anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the antinuclear environmental and peace movements the counterculture of the 1960s and the New Left57 It also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative anticapitalist reformism58 Anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols59 The established feminist tendencies of anarchafeminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism60 Black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchisms move from a Eurocentric demographic61 This coincided with its failure to gain traction in Northern Europe and its unprecedented height in Latin America62 Around the turn of the 21st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anticapitalist antiwar and antiglobalisation movements63 Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the World Trade Organization WTO the Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum During the protests ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with the police Other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include affinity groups security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the 1999 Seattle WTO conference63 Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the Zapatistas in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria more commonly known as Rojava a de facto autonomous region in northern Syria64 Anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions social anarchism and individualist anarchism owing to their different origins values and evolution65 The individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership66 In a chronological sense anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the postclassical currents anarchafeminism green anarchism and postanarchism developed thereafter67 Beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it68 A component especially of individualist anarchism69 philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state but claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy70 Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy71 Anarchisms emphasis on anticapitalism egalitarianism and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarchocapitalism and other types of economic libertarianism21 Anarchism is usually placed on the farleft of the political spectrum72 Much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect antiauthoritarian antistatist libertarian and radical interpretations of leftwing and socialist politics13 such as collectivism communism individualism mutualism and syndicalism among other libertarian socialist economic theories73 As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview74 many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely75 One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time76 Belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists77 Despite separation the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy mutual aid network organisation communal democracy justified authority and decentralisation78 Inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism They were followed by the major currents of social anarchism collectivist communist and syndicalist They differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society80 Mutualism is an 18thcentury economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by PierreJoseph Proudhon Its aims include reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people81 Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism82 In What Is Property 1840 Proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property83 Collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism84 commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin85 Collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution86 and that workers be paid according to time worked rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism Collectivist anarchism arose alongside Marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society87 Anarchocommunism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production88 direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations workers councils and worker cooperatives with production and consumption based on the guiding principle From each according to his ability to each according to his need89 Anarchocommunism developed from radical socialist currents after the French Revolution90 but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International91 It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin92 whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century93 Anarchosyndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically selfmanaged by workers The basic principles of anarchosyndicalism are direct action workers solidarity and workers selfmanagement94 Individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants95 Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include William Godwin Max Stirner and Henry David Thoreau Through many countries individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals96 as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation97 Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the antiglobalisation movement98 whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation99 As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest99 Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches100page neededThe anticapitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents101 Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchisms historical association with chaos and violence Its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory102 Various anarchist groups tendencies and schools of thought exist today making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement103 While theorists and activists have established relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple anarchisms rather than a singular anarchism in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently Gender equality can be a common principle although it ranks as a higher priority to anarchafeminists than anarchocommunists104 Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms namely all centralized and hierarchical forms of government eg monarchy representative democracy state socialism etc economic class systems eg capitalism Bolshevism feudalism slavery etc autocratic religions eg fundamentalist Islam Roman Catholicism etc patriarchy heterosexism white supremacy and imperialism105 Anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed106 The principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions This entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy107 To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler All emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind He was I take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position He never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer They were admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results Grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his And yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late Irene Adler of dubious and questionable memory I had seen little of Holmes lately My marriage had drifted us away from each other My own complete happiness and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while Holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in Baker Street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature He was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland Beyond these signs of his activity however which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press I knew little of my former friend and companion One nightit was on the twentieth of March 1888I was returning from a journey to a patient for I had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through Baker Street As I passed the wellremembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers His rooms were brilliantly lit and even as I looked up I saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind He was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him To me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story He was at work again He had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own His manner was not effusive It seldom was but he was glad I think to see me With hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion Wedlock suits you he remarked I think Watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you Seven I answered Indeed I should have thought a little more Just a trifle more I fancy Watson And in practice again I observe You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness Then how do you know I see it I deduce it How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl My dear Holmes said I this is too much You would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as I have changed my clothes I cant imagine how you deduce it As to Mary Jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again I fail to see how you work it out He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together It is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it Hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the London slavey As to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope I must be dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction When I hear you give your reasons I remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours Quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair You see but you do not observe The distinction is clear For example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room Frequently How often Well some hundreds of times Then how many are there How many I dont know Quite so You have not observed And yet you have seen That is just my point Now I know that there are seventeen steps because I have both seen and observed By the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this He threw over a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table It came by the last post said he Read it aloud The note was undated and without either signature or address There will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated This account of you we have from all quarters received Be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask This is indeed a mystery I remarked What do you imagine that it means I have no data yet It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts But the note itself What do you deduce from it I carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written The man who wrote it was presumably well to do I remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet It is peculiarly strong and stiff Peculiarthat is the very word said Holmes It is not an English paper at all Hold it up to the light I did so and saw a large E with a small g a P and a large G with a small t woven into the texture of the paper What do you make of that asked Holmes The name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather Not at all The G with the small t stands for Gesellschaft which is the German for Company It is a customary contraction like our Co P of course stands for Papier Now for the Eg Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves Eglow Eglonitzhere we are Egria It is in a Germanspeaking countryin Bohemia not far from Carlsbad Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein and for its numerous glassfactories and papermills Ha ha my boy what do you make of that His eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette The paper was made in Bohemia I said Precisely And the man who wrote the note is a German Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentenceThis account of you we have from all quarters received A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs It only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face And here he comes if I am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell Holmes whistled A pair by the sound said he Yes he continued glancing out of the window A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties A hundred and fifty guineas apiece Theres money in this case Watson if there is nothing else I think that I had better go Holmes Not a bit Doctor Stay where you are I am lost without my Boswell And this promises to be interesting It would be a pity to miss it But your client Never mind him I may want your help and so may he Here he comes Sit down in that armchair Doctor and give us your best attention A slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door Then there was a loud and authoritative tap Come in said Holmes A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a Hercules His dress was rich with a richness which would in England be looked upon as akin to bad taste Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl Boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance He carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy You had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent I told you that I would call He looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address Pray take a seat said Holmes This is my friend and colleague Dr Watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases Whom have I the honour to address You may address me as the Count Von Kramm a Bohemian nobleman I understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance If not I should much prefer to communicate with you alone I rose to go but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair It is both or none said he You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me The Count shrugged his broad shoulders Then I must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history I promise said Holmes And I You will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own I was aware of it said Holmes dryly The circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe To speak plainly the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein hereditary kings of Bohemia I was also aware of that murmured Holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client If your Majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked I should be better able to advise you The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation Then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground You are right he cried I am the King Why should I attempt to conceal it Why indeed murmured Holmes Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein Grand Duke of CasselFelstein and hereditary King of Bohemia But you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you Then pray consult said Holmes shutting his eyes once more The facts are briefly these Some five years ago during a lengthy visit to Warsaw I made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress Irene Adler The name is no doubt familiar to you Kindly look her up in my index Doctor murmured Holmes without opening his eyes For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staffcommander who had written a monograph upon the deepsea fishes Let me see said Holmes Hum Born in New Jersey in the year 1858 Contraltohum La Scala hum Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsawyes Retired from operatic stageha Living in Londonquite so Your Majesty as I understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back Precisely so But how Was there a secret marriage None No legal papers or certificates None Then I fail to follow your Majesty If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity There is the writing Pooh pooh Forgery My private notepaper Stolen My own seal Imitated My photograph Bought We were both in the photograph Oh dear That is very bad Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion I was madinsane You have compromised yourself seriously I was only Crown Prince then I was young I am but thirty now It must be recovered We have tried and failed Your Majesty must pay It must be bought She will not sell Stolen then Five attempts have been made Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled Twice she has been waylaid There has been no result No sign of it Absolutely none Holmes laughed It is quite a pretty little problem said he But a very serious one to me returned the King reproachfully Very indeed And what does she propose to do with the photograph To ruin me But how I am about to be married So I have heard To Clotilde Lothman von SaxeMeningen second daughter of the King of Scandinavia You may know the strict principles of her family She is herself the very soul of delicacy A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end And Irene Adler Threatens to send them the photograph And she will do it I know that she will do it You do not know her but she has a soul of steel She has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men Rather than I should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not gonone You are sure that she has not sent it yet I am sure And why Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed That will be next Monday Oh then we have three days yet said Holmes with a yawn That is very fortunate as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present Your Majesty will of course stay in London for the present Certainly You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress Pray do so I shall be all anxiety Then as to money You have carte blanche Absolutely I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph And for present expenses The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him And Mademoiselles address he asked Is Briony Lodge Serpentine Avenue St Johns Wood Holmes took a note of it One other question said he Was the photograph a cabinet It was Then goodnight your Majesty and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you And goodnight Watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street If you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three oclock I should like to chat this little matter over with you II At three oclock precisely I was at Baker Street but Holmes had not yet returned The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight oclock in the morning I sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be I was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own Indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head It was close upon four before the door opened and a drunkenlooking groom illkempt and sidewhiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room Accustomed as I was to my friends amazing powers in the use of disguises I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he With a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweedsuited and respectable as of old Putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes Well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair What is it Its quite too funny I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning or what I ended by doing I cant imagine I suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of Miss Irene Adler Quite so but the sequel was rather unusual I will tell you however I left the house a little after eight oclock this morning in the character of a groom out of work There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men Be one of them and you will know all that there is to know I soon found Briony Lodge It is a bijou villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories Chubb lock to the door Large sittingroom on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open Behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coachhouse I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest I then lounged down the street and found as I expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of halfandhalf two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to And what of Irene Adler I asked Oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet So say the Serpentinemews to a man She lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner Seldom goes out at other times except when she sings Has only one male visitor but a good deal of him He is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice He is a Mr Godfrey Norton of the Inner Temple See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentinemews and knew all about him When I had listened to all they had to tell I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter He was a lawyer That sounded ominous What was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits Was she his client his friend or his mistress If the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping If the latter it was less likely On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the Temple It was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry I fear that I bore you with these details but I have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation I am following you closely I answered I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman sprang out He was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently the man of whom I had heard He appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man Bilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity and though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms he described the whole campaign with a fearless selfcensure and selfderision genuinely Russian Bilibin wrote that the obligation of diplomatic discretion tormented him and he was happy to have in Prince Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army The letter was old having been written before the battle at PreussischEylau Since the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz wrote Bilibin as you know my dear prince I never leave headquarters I have certainly acquired a taste for war and it is just as well for me what I have seen during these last three months is incredible I begin ab ovo The enemy of the human race as you know attacks the Prussians The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us three times in three years We take up their cause but it turns out that the enemy of the human race pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the palace at Potsdam I most ardently desire writes the King of Prussia to Bonaparte that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a manner agreeable to yourself and in so far as circumstances allowed I have hastened to take all steps to that end May I have succeeded The Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the French and lay down their arms at the first demand The head of the garrison at Glogau with ten thousand men asks the King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender All this is absolutely true In short hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war and what is more in war on our own frontiers with and for the King of Prussia We have everything in perfect order only one little thing is lacking namely a commander in chief As it was considered that the Austerlitz success might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so young all our octogenarians were reviewed and of Prozorovski and Kamenski the latter was preferred The general comes to us Suvorovlike in a kibitka and is received with acclamations of joy and triumph On the 4th the first courier arrives from Petersburg The mails are taken to the field marshals room for he likes to do everything himself I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to him We search but none are to be found The field marshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor to Count T Prince V and others Then he bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything seizes the letters opens them and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others Ah So thats the way they treat me No confidence in me Ah ordered to keep an eye on me Very well then Get along with you So he writes the famous order of the day to General Bennigsen I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the army You have brought your army corps to Pultusk routed here it is exposed and without fuel or forage so something must be done and as you yourself reported to Count Buxhowden yesterday you must think of retreating to our frontierwhich do today From all my riding he writes to the Emperor I have got a saddle sore which coming after all my previous journeys quite prevents my riding and commanding so vast an army so I have passed on the command to the general next in seniority Count Buxhowden having sent him my whole staff and all that belongs to it advising him if there is a lack of bread to move farther into the interior of Prussia for only one days ration of bread remains and in some regiments none at all as reported by the division commanders Ostermann and Sedmoretzki and all that the peasants had has been eaten up I myself will remain in hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover In regard to which I humbly submit my report with the information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious task for which he was chosen I shall await your most gracious permission here in hospital that I may not have to play the part of a secretary rather than commander in the army My removal from the army does not produce the slightest stira blind man has left it There are thousands such as I in Russia The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all isnt it logical This is the first act Those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining After the field marshals departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle Buxhowden is commander in chief by seniority but General Bennigsen does not quite see it more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle on his own hand as the Germans say He does so This is the battle of Pultusk which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind We civilians as you know have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pultusk In short we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory and General Bennigsen hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory does not give up the command of the army to General Buxhowden During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers Our aim is no longer as it should be to avoid or attack the enemy but solely to avoid General Buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief So energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy who at the moment is not Bonaparte but Buxhowden General Buxhowden was all but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him Buxhowden pursues uswe scuttle He hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to the other At last our enemy Buxhowden catches us and attacks Both generals are angry and the result is a challenge on Buxhowdens part and an epileptic fit on Bennigsens But at the critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at Pultusk to Petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in chief and our first foe Buxhowden is vanquished we can now turn our thoughts to the second Bonaparte But as it turns out just at that moment a third enemy rises before us namely the Orthodox Russian soldiers loudly demanding bread meat biscuits fodder and whatnot The stores are empty the roads impassable The Orthodox begin looting and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea Half the regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword The inhabitants are totally ruined the hospitals overflow with sick and famine is everywhere Twice the marauders even attack our headquarters and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them During one of these attacks they carried off my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown The Emperor proposes to give all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders but I much fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other At first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only but after a while in spite of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trust Bilibin what he had read began to interest him more and more When he had read thus far he crumpled the letter up and threw it away It was not what he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life out there in which he had now no part could perturb him He shut his eyes rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had read and listened to what was passing in the nursery Suddenly he thought he heard a strange noise through the door He was seized with alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was reading the letter He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot My dear he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he was seized by an unreasoning panicit occurred to him that the child was dead All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror All is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead He went to the cot in confusion sure that he would find it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby He drew the curtain aside and for some time his frightened restless eyes could not find the baby At last he saw him the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow and was smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly Prince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that as if he had already lost him He bent over him and as his sister had taught him tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish The soft forehead was moist Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand even the hair was wet so profusely had the child perspired He was not dead but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent Prince Andrew longed to snatch up to squeeze to hold to his heart this helpless little creature but dared not do so He stood over him gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket He heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the cot He did not look round but still gazing at the infants face listened to his regular breathing The dark shadow was Princess Mary who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps lifted the curtain and dropped it again behind her Prince Andrew recognized her without looking and held out his hand to her She pressed it He has perspired said Prince Andrew I was coming to tell you so The child moved slightly in his sleep smiled and rubbed his forehead against the pillow Prince Andrew looked at his sister In the dim shadow of the curtain her luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that were in them She leaned over to her brother and kissed him slightly catching the curtain of the cot Each made the other a warning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the world Prince Andrew was the first to move away ruffling his hair against the muslin of the curtain Yes this is the one thing left me now he said with a sigh There was music from my neighbours house through the summer nights In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats slit the waters of the Sound drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam On weekends his RollsRoyce became an omnibus bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains And on Mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbingbrushes and hammers and gardenshears repairing the ravages of the night before Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New Yorkevery Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butlers thumb At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsbys enormous garden On buffet tables garnished with glistening horsdoeuvre spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another By seven oclock the orchestra has arrived no thin fivepiece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours and hair bobbed in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each others names The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher Laughter is easier minute by minute spilled with prodigality tipped out at a cheerful word The groups change more swiftly swell with new arrivals dissolve and form in the same breath already there are wanderers confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable become for a sharp joyous moment the centre of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the seachange of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal seizes a cocktail out of the air dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform A momentary hush the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Grays understudy from the Follies The party has begun I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsbys house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited People were not invitedthey went there They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsbys door Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission I had been actually invited A chauffeur in a uniform of robinsegg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer the honour would be entirely Gatsbys it said if I would attend his little party that night He had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented itsigned Jay Gatsby in a majestic hand Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didnt knowthough here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about all well dressed all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans I was sure that they were selling something bonds or insurance or automobiles They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail tablethe only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden Welcome or not I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby Hello I roared advancing toward her My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden I thought you might be here she responded absently as I came up I remembered you lived next door to She held my hand impersonally as a promise that shed take care of me in a minute and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps Hello they cried together Sorry you didnt win That was for the golf tournament She had lost in the finals the week before You dont know who we are said one of the girls in yellow but we met you here about a month ago Youve dyed your hair since then remarked Jordan and I started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon produced like the supper no doubt out of a caterers basket With Jordans slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men each one introduced to us as Mr Mumble Do you come to these parties often inquired Jordan of the girl beside her The last one was the one I met you at answered the girl in an alert confident voice She turned to her companion Wasnt it for you Lucille It was for Lucille too I like to come Lucille said I never care what I do so I always have a good time When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair and he asked me my name and addressinside of a week I got a package from Croiriers with a new evening gown in it Did you keep it asked Jordan Sure I did I was going to wear it tonight but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered It was gas blue with lavender beads Two hundred and sixtyfive dollars Theres something funny about a fellow thatll do a thing like that said the other girl eagerly He doesnt want any trouble with anybody Who doesnt I inquired Gatsby Somebody told me The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once A thrill passed over all of us The three Mr Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly I dont think its so much that argued Lucille sceptically Its more that he was a German spy during the war One of the men nodded in confirmation I heard that from a man who knew all about him grew up with him in Germany he assured us positively Oh no said the first girl it couldnt be that because he was in the American army during the war As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobodys looking at him Ill bet he killed a man She narrowed her eyes and shivered Lucille shivered We all turned and looked around for Gatsby It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world The first supperthere would be another one after midnightwas now being served and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden There were three married couples and Jordans escort a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countrysideEast Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety Lets get out whispered Jordan after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate halfhour this is much too polite for me We got up and she explained that we were going to find the host I had never met him she said and it was making me uneasy The undergraduate nodded in a cynical melancholy way The bar where we glanced first was crowded but Gatsby was not there She couldnt find him from the top of the steps and he wasnt on the veranda On a chance we tried an importantlooking door and walked into a high Gothic library panelled with carved English oak and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas A stout middleaged man with enormous owleyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot What do you think he demanded impetuously About what He waved his hand toward the bookshelves About that As a matter of fact you neednt bother to ascertain I ascertained Theyre real The books He nodded Absolutely realhave pages and everything I thought theyd be a nice durable cardboard Matter of fact theyre absolutely real Pages andHere Lemme show you Taking our scepticism for granted he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures See he cried triumphantly Its a bonafide piece of printed matter It fooled me This fellas a regular Belasco Its a triumph What thoroughness What realism Knew when to stop toodidnt cut the pages But what do you want What do you expect He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse Who brought you he demanded Or did you just come I was brought Most people were brought Jordan looked at him alertly cheerfully without answering I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt he continued Mrs Claud Roosevelt Do you know her I met her somewhere last night Ive been drunk for about a week now and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library Has it A little bit I think I cant tell yet Ive only been here an hour Did I tell you about the books Theyre real Theyre You told us We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles superior couples holding each other tortuously fashionably and keeping in the cornersand a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps By midnight the hilarity had increased A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing stunts all over the garden while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky A pair of stage twins who turned out to be the girls in yellow did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than fingerbowls The moon had risen higher and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales trembling a little to the stiff tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn I was still with Jordan Baker We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter I was enjoying myself now I had taken two fingerbowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant elemental and profound At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled Your face is familiar he said politely Werent you in the First Division during the war Why yes I was in the Twentyeighth Infantry I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteeneighteen I knew Id seen you somewhere before We talked for a moment about some wet grey little villages in France Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning Want to go with me old sport Just near the shore along the Sound What time Any time that suits you best It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled Having a gay time now she inquired Much better I turned again to my new acquaintance This is an unusual party for me I havent even seen the host I live over there I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand Im Gatsby he said suddenly What I exclaimed Oh I beg your pardon I thought you knew old sport Im afraid Im not a very good host He smiled understandinglymuch more than understandingly It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it that you may come across four or five times in life It facedor seemed to facethe whole eternal world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that at your best you hoped to convey Precisely at that point it vanishedand I was looking at an elegant young roughneck a year or two over thirty whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd Some time before he introduced himself Id got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care Almost at the moment when Mr Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn If you want anything just ask for it old sport he urged me Excuse me I will rejoin you later When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordanconstrained to assure her of my surprise I had expected that Mr Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years Who is he I demanded Do you know Hes just a man named Gatsby Where is he from I mean And what does he do Now youre started on the subject she answered with a wan smile Well he told me once he was an Oxford man A dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away However I dont believe it Why not I dont know she insisted I just dont think he went there Something in her tone reminded me of the other girls I think he killed a man and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York That was comprehensible But young men didntat least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didntdrift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound Anyhow he gives large parties said Jordan changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete And I like large parties Theyre so intimate At small parties there isnt any privacy There was the boom of a bass drum and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden Ladies and gentlemen he cried At the request of Mr Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr Vladmir Tostoffs latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation He smiled with jovial condescension and added Some sensation Whereupon everybody laughed The piece is known he concluded lustily as Vladmir Tostoffs Jazz History of the World  The nature of Mr Tostoffs composition eluded me because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day I could see nothing sinister about him I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased When the Jazz History of the World was over girls were putting their heads on mens shoulders in a puppyish convivial way girls were swooning backward playfully into mens arms even into groups knowing that someone would arrest their fallsbut no one swooned backward on Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsbys shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsbys head for one link I beg your pardon Gatsbys butler was suddenly standing beside us Miss Baker he inquired I beg your pardon but Mr Gatsby would like to speak to you alone With me she exclaimed in surprise Yes madame She got up slowly raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment and followed the butler toward the house I noticed that she wore her eveningdress all her dresses like sports clothesthere was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean crisp mornings I was alone and it was almost two For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long manywindowed room which overhung the terrace Eluding Jordans undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls and who implored me to join him I went inside The large room was full of people One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall redhaired young lady from a famous chorus engaged in song She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sadshe was not only singing she was weeping too Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano The tears coursed down her cheeksnot freely however for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep She had a fight with a man who says hes her husband explained a girl at my elbow I looked around Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands Even Jordans party the quartet from East Egg were rent asunder by dissension One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacksat intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond and hissed You promised into his ear The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices Whenever he sees Im having a good time he wants to go home Never heard anything so selfish in my life Were always the first ones to leave So are we Well were almost the last tonight said one of the men sheepishly The orchestra left half an hour ago In spite of the wives agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility the dispute ended in a short struggle and both wives were lifted kicking into the night As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye Jordans party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands Ive just heard the most amazing thing she whispered How long were we in there Why about an hour It was  simply amazing she repeated abstractedly But I swore I wouldnt tell it and here I am tantalizing you She yawned gracefully in my face Please come and see me  Phone book  Under the name of Mrs Sigourney Howard  My aunt  She was hurrying off as she talkedher brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late I joined the last of Gatsbys guests who were clustered around him I wanted to explain that Id hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden Dont mention it he enjoined me eagerly Dont give it another thought old sport The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder And dont forget were going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine oclock Then the butler behind his shoulder Philadelphia wants you on the phone sir All right in a minute Tell them Ill be right there  Good night Good night Good night He smiledand suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go as if he had desired it all the time Good night old sport  Good night But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene In the ditch beside the road right side up but violently shorn of one wheel rested a new coupé which had left Gatsbys drive not two minutes before The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs However as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant puzzled way See he explained It went in the ditch The fact was infinitely astonishing to him and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the manit was the late patron of Gatsbys library Howd it happen He shrugged his shoulders I know nothing whatever about mechanics he said decisively But how did it happen Did you run into the wall Dont ask me said Owl Eyes washing his hands of the whole matter I know very little about drivingnext to nothing It happened and thats all I know Well if youre a poor driver you oughtnt to try driving at night But I wasnt even trying he explained indignantly I wasnt even trying An awed hush fell upon the bystanders Do you want to commit suicide Youre lucky it was just a wheel A bad driver and not even trying You dont understand explained the criminal I wasnt driving Theres another man in the car The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained Ahhh as the door of the coupé swung slowly open The crowdit was now a crowdstepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause Then very gradually part by part a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster Whas matter he inquired calmly Did we run outa gas Look Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheelhe stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky It came off someone explained He nodded At first I din notice wed stopped A pause Then taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice Wonderff tell me where theres a gasline station At least a dozen men some of them a little better off than he was explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond Back out he suggested after a moment Put her in reverse But the wheels off He hesitated No harm in trying he said The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home I glanced back once A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsbys house making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell  Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me On the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and until much later they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs Most of the time I worked In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust I knew the other clerks and young bondsalesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away I took dinner usually at the Yale Clubfor some reason it was the gloomiest event of my dayand then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour There were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work After that if the night was mellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station I began to like New York the racy adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives and no one would ever know or disapprove Sometimes in my mind I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes and felt it in otherspoor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinneryoung clerks in the dusk wasting the most poignant moments of night and life Again at eight oclock when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs bound for the theatre district I felt a sinking in my heart Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited and voices sang and there was laughter from unheard jokes and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside Imagining that I too was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement I wished them well For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker and then in midsummer I found her again At first I was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and everyone knew her name Then it was something more I wasnt actually in love but I felt a sort of tender curiosity The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed somethingmost affectations conceal something eventually even though they dont in the beginningand one day I found what it was When we were on a houseparty together up in Warwick she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down and then lied about itand suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisys At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapersa suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round The thing approached the proportions of a scandalthen died away A caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken The incident and the name had remained together in my mind Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever shrewd men and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible She was incurably dishonest She wasnt able to endure being at a disadvantage and given this unwillingness I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body It made no difference to me Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeplyI was casually sorry and then I forgot It was on that same houseparty that we had a curious conversation about driving a car It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one mans coat Youre a rotten driver I protested Either you ought to be more careful or you oughtnt to drive at all I am careful No youre not Well other people are she said lightly Whats that got to do with it Theyll keep out of my way she insisted It takes two to make an accident Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself I hope I never will she answered I hate careless people Thats why I like you Her grey sunstrained eyes stared straight ahead but she had deliberately shifted our relations and for a moment I thought I loved her But I am slowthinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home Id been writing letters once a week and signing them Love Nick and all I could think of was how when that certain girl played tennis a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues and this is mine I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known IV On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore the world and its mistress returned to Gatsbys house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn Hes a bootlegger said the young ladies moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil Reach me a rose honey and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to Gatsbys house that summer It is an old timetable now disintegrating at its folds and headed This schedule in effect July 5th 1922 But I can still read the grey names and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsbys hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him From East Egg then came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a man named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who was drowned last summer up in Maine And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near And the Ismays and the Chrysties or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr Chrysties wife and Edgar Beaver whose hair they say turned cottonwhite one winter afternoon for no good reason at all Clarence Endive was from East Egg as I remember He came only once in white knickerbockers and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O R P Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs Ulysses Swetts automobile ran over his right hand The Dancies came too and S B Whitebait who was well over sixty and Maurice A Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the tobacco importer and Belugas girls From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid who controlled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S Schwartz the son and Arthur McCarty all connected with the movies in one way or another And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G Earl Muldoon brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife Da Fontano the promoter came there and Ed Legros and James B RotGut Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lillythey came to gamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as the boarderI doubt if he had any other home Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace ODonavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S W Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns divorced now and Henry L Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls They were never quite the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before I have forgotten their namesJaqueline I think or else Consuela or Gloria or Judy or June and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins if pressed they would confess themselves to be In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina OBrien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and Mr Albrucksburger and Miss Haag his fiancée and Ardita FitzPeters and Mr P Jewett once head of the American Legion and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her chauffeur and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name if I ever knew it I have forgotten All these people came to Gatsbys house in the summer Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood Pierre went to the Kiev province where he had the greatest number of serfs taking with him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to what he should do on his estates When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and explained to them his intentions and wishes He told them that steps would be taken immediately to free his serfsand that till then they were not to be overburdened with labor women while nursing their babies were not to be sent to work assistance was to be given to the serfs punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal and hospitals asylums and schools were to be established on all the estates Some of the stewards there were semiliterate foremen among them listened with alarm supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased with their management and embezzlement of money some after their first fright were amused by Pierres lisp and the new words they had not heard before others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked while the cleverest among them including the chief steward understood from this speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends The chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierres intentions but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory Despite Count Bezukhovs enormous wealth since he had come into an income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an allowance of ten thousand rubles He had a dim perception of the following budget About 80000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank about 30000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow the town house and the allowance to the three princesses about 15000 was given in pensions and the same amount for asylums 150000 alimony was sent to the countess about 7000 went for interest on debts The building of a new church previously begun had cost about 10000 in each of the last two years and he did not know how the rest about 100000 rubles was spent and almost every year he was obliged to borrow Besides this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops So the first task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or inclinationpractical business He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward But he felt that this did not forward matters at all He felt that these consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with them or make them move On the one hand the chief steward put the state of things to him in the very worst light pointing out the necessity of paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor to which Pierre did not agree On the other hand Pierre demanded that steps should be taken to liberate the serfs which the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation The steward did not say it was quite impossible but suggested selling the forests in the province of Kostroma the land lower down the river and the Crimean estate in order to make it possible all of which operations according to him were connected with such complicated measuresthe removal of injunctions petitions permits and so onthat Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied Yes yes do so Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it The steward for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to himself In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew and strangers hastened to make his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer the largest landowner of the province Temptations to Pierres greatest weaknessthe one to which he had confessed when admitted to the Lodgewere so strong that he could not resist them Again whole days weeks and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied with evening parties dinners lunches and balls giving him no time for reflection as in Petersburg Instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the old life only in new surroundings Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral life and that of the seven virtues he lacked twomorality and the love of death He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another of the preceptsthat of reforming the human race and had other virtueslove of his neighbor and especially generosity In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg On the way he intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit The chief steward who considered the young counts attempts almost insaneunprofitable to himself to the count and to the serfsmade some concessions Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as impracticable he arranged for the erection of large buildingsschools hospitals and asylumson all the estates before the master arrived Everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes which he knew Pierre would not like but for just such gratefully religious ones with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality as according to his understanding of his master would touch and delude him The southern spring the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna carriage and the solitude of the road all had a gladdening effect on Pierre The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque than the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them Everywhere were receptions which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart In one place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul asking permission as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of Peter and Paul his patron saints In another place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work On a third estate the priest bearing a cross came to meet him surrounded by children whom by the counts generosity he was instructing in reading writing and religion On all his estates Pierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection all on one plan for hospitals schools and almshouses which were soon to be opened Everywhere he saw the stewards accounts according to which the serfs manorial labor had been diminished and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their fullskirted blue coats What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St Peters day and that the richest peasants who formed the deputation had begun the chantry long before but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty He did not know that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land they did still harder work on their own land He did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions and that the pupils parents wept at having to let him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments He did not know that the brick buildings built to plan were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased though lessened on paper He did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs payments had been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a half And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left Petersburg and wrote enthusiastic letters to his brotherinstructor as he called the Grand Master How easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much good thought Pierre and how little attention we pay to it He was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed at receiving it This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these simple kindly people The chief steward a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly through the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all the uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it was Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult to imagine happier people and that God only knew what would happen to them when they were free but he insisted though reluctantly on what he thought right The steward promised to do all in his power to carry out the counts wishes seeing clearly that not only would the count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued to give in money and work all that other peoples serfs gavethat is to say all that could be got out of them CHAPTER XI Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state of mind Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his friend Bolkonski whom he had not seen for two years Bogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields and forests of fir and birch which were partly cut down The house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks still bare of grass It was at the end of a village that stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir trees The homestead consisted of a threshing floor outhouses stables a bathhouse a lodge and a large brick house with semicircular facade still in course of construction Round the house was a garden newly laid out The fences and gates were new and solid two fire pumps and a water cart painted green stood in a shed the paths were straight the bridges were strong and had handrails Everything bore an impress of tidiness and good management Some domestic serfs Pierre met in reply to inquiries as to where the prince lived pointed out a small newly built lodge close to the pond Anton a man who had looked after Prince Andrew in his boyhood helped Pierre out of his carriage said that the prince was at home and showed him into a clean little anteroom Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in Petersburg He quickly entered the small reception room with its stillunplastered wooden walls redolent of pine and would have gone farther but Anton ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door Well what is it came a sharp unpleasant voice A visitor answered Anton Ask him to wait and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face with Prince Andrew who came out frowning and looking old Pierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek and looked at him closely Well I did not expect you I am very glad said Prince Andrew Pierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise He was struck by the change in him His words were kindly and there was a smile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and glad sparkle Prince Andrew had grown thinner paler and more manlylooking but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation it was long before their conversation could settle on anything They put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be talked over at length At last the conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first lightly touched on their past life plans for the future Pierres journeys and occupations the war and so on The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friends look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying but could not The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms dreams and hopes of happiness or goodness in Prince Andrews presence He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour He checked himself fearing to seem naive yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different and better Pierre than he had been in Petersburg I cant tell you how much I have lived through since then I hardly know myself again Yes we have altered much very much since then said Prince Andrew Well and you What are your plans Plans repeated Prince Andrew ironically My plans he said as if astonished at the word Well you see Im building I mean to settle here altogether next year Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrews face which had grown much older No I meant to ask Pierre began but Prince Andrew interrupted him But why talk of me Talk to me yes tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierres story of what he had been doing as though it were all an oldtime story and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friends company and at last became silent Ill tell you what my dear fellow said Prince Andrew who evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor I am only bivouacking here and have just come to look round I am going back to my sister today I will introduce you to her But of course you know her already he said evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he now found nothing in common We will go after dinner And would you now like to look round my place They went out and walked about till dinnertime talking of the political news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other intimately Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings but even here while on the scaffolding in the midst of a talk explaining the future arrangements of the house he interrupted himself However this is not at all interesting Let us have dinner and then well set off At dinner conversation turned on Pierres marriage I was very much surprised when I heard of it said Prince Andrew Pierre blushed as he always did when it was mentioned and said hurriedly I will tell you some time how it all happened But you know it is all over and forever Forever said Prince Andrew Nothings forever But you know how it all ended dont you You heard of the duel And so you had to go through that too One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man said Pierre Why so asked Prince Andrew To kill a vicious dog is a very good thing really No to kill a man is badwrong Why is it wrong urged Prince Andrew It is not given to man to know what is right and what is wrong Men always did and always will err and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong What does harm to another is wrong said Pierre feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused had begun to talk and wanted to express what had brought him to his present state And who has told you what is bad for another man he asked Bad Bad exclaimed Pierre We all know what is bad for ourselves Yes we know that but the harm I am conscious of in myself is something I cannot inflict on others said Prince Andrew growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to Pierre He spoke in French I only know two very real evils in life remorse and illness The only good is the absence of those evils To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now And love of ones neighbor and selfsacrifice began Pierre No I cant agree with you To live only so as not to do evil and not to have to repent is not enough I lived like that I lived for myself and ruined my life And only now when I am living or at least trying Pierres modesty made him correct himself to live for others only now have I understood all the happiness of life No I shall not agree with you and you do not really believe what you are saying Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile When you see my sister Princess Mary youll get on with her he said Perhaps you are right for yourself he added after a short pause but everyone lives in his own way You lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for others I experienced just the reverse I lived for gloryAnd after all what is glory The same love of others a desire to do something for them a desire for their approvalSo I lived for others and not almost but quite ruined my life And I have become calmer since I began to live only for myself But what do you mean by living only for yourself asked Pierre growing excited What about your son your sister and your father But thats just the same as myselfthey are not others explained Prince Andrew The others ones neighbors le prochain as you and Princess Mary call it are the chief source of all error and evil Le prochainyour Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good And he looked at Pierre with a mocking challenging expression He evidently wished to draw him on You are joking replied Pierre growing more and more excited What error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good and even doing a littlethough I did very little and did it very badly What evil can there be in it if unfortunate people our serfs people like ourselves were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in future life retribution recompense and consolation What evil and error are there in it if people were dying of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be rendered and I supplied them with a doctor a hospital and an asylum for the aged And is it not a palpable unquestionable good if a peasant or a woman with a baby has no rest day or night and I give them rest and leisure said Pierre hurrying and lisping And I have done that though badly and to a small extent but I have done something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action and more than that you cant make me believe that you do not think so yourself And the main thing is he continued that I know and know for certain that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happiness in life Yes if you put it like that its quite a different matter said Prince Andrew I build a house and lay out a garden and you build hospitals The one and the other may serve as a pastime But whats right and whats good must be judged by one who knows all but not by us Well you want an argument he added come on then They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda Come lets argue then said Prince Andrew You talk of schools he went on crooking a finger education and so forth that is you want to raise him pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible and that is just what you want to deprive him of I envy him but you want to make him what I am without giving him my means Then you say lighten his toil But as I see it physical labor is as essential to him as much a condition of his existence as mental activity is to you or me You cant help thinking I go to bed after two in the morning thoughts come and I cant sleep but toss about till dawn because I think and cant help thinking just as he cant help plowing and mowing if he didnt he would go to the drink shop or fall ill Just as I could not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week so he could not stand my physical idleness but would grow fat and die The third thingwhat else was it you talked about and Prince Andrew crooked a third finger Ah yes hospitals medicine He has a fit he is dying and you come and bleed him and patch him up He will drag about as a cripple a burden to everybody for another ten years It would be far easier and simpler for him to die Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is It would be different if you grudged losing a laborerthats how I regard himbut you want to cure him from love of him And he does not want that And besides what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone Killed them yes said he frowning angrily and turning away from Pierre Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he spoke readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time His glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless Oh that is dreadful dreadful said Pierre I dont understand how one can live with such ideas I had such moments myself not long ago in Moscow and when traveling but at such times I collapsed so that I dont live at alleverything seems hateful to me myself most of all Then I dont eat dont wash and how is it with you Why not wash That is not cleanly said Prince Andrew on the contrary one must try to make ones life as pleasant as possible Im alive that is not my fault so I must live out my life as best I can without hurting others But with such ideas what motive have you for living One would sit without moving undertaking nothing Life as it is leaves one no peace I should be thankful to do nothing but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to choose me to be their marshal it was all I could do to get out of it They could not understand that I have not the necessary qualifications for itthe kind of goodnatured fussy shallowness necessary for the position Then theres this house which must be built in order to have a nook of ones own in which to be quiet And now theres this recruiting Why arent you serving in the army After Austerlitz said Prince Andrew gloomily No thank you very much I have promised myself not to serve again in the active Russian army And I wontnot even if Bonaparte were here at Smolensk threatening Bald Hillseven then I wouldnt serve in the Russian army Well as I was saying he continued recovering his composure now theres this recruiting My father is chief in command of the Third District and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under him Then you are serving I am He paused a little while And why do you serve Why for this reason My father is one of the most remarkable men of his time But he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he has too energetic a character He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is terrible and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of the recruiting granted by the Emperor If I had been two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymasters clerk at Yukhnovna hanged said Prince Andrew with a smile So I am serving because I alone have any influence with my father and now and then can save him from actions which would torment him afterwards Well there you see Yes but it is not as you imagine Prince Andrew continued I did not and do not in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen some boots from the recruits I should even have been very glad to see him hanged but I was sorry for my fatherthat again is for myself Prince Andrew grew more and more animated His eyes glittered feverishly while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no desire to do good to his neighbor There now you wish to liberate your serfs he continued that is a very good thing but not for youI dont suppose you ever had anyone flogged or sent to Siberiaand still less for your serfs If they are beaten flogged or sent to Siberia I dont suppose they are any the worse off In Siberia they lead the same animal life and the stripes on their bodies heal and they are happy as before But it is a good thing for proprietors who perish morally bring remorse upon themselves stifle this remorse and grow callous as a result of being able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly It is those people I pity and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs You may not have seen but I have seen how good men brought up in those traditions of unlimited power in time when they grow more irritable become cruel and harsh are conscious of it but cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable Prince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his fathers case He did not reply So thats what Im sorry forhuman dignity peace of mind purity and not the serfs backs and foreheads which beat and shave as you may always remain the same backs and foreheads No no A thousand times no I shall never agree with you said Pierre CHAPTER XII In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to Bald Hills Prince Andrew glancing at Pierre broke the silence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper Pointing to the fields he spoke of the improvements he was making in his husbandry Pierre remained gloomily silent answering in monosyllables and apparently immersed in his own thoughts He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy had gone astray did not see the true light and that he Pierre ought to aid enlighten and raise him But as soon as he thought of what he should say he felt that Prince Andrew with one word one argument would upset all his teaching and he shrank from beginning afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what to him was precious and sacred No but why do you think so Pierre suddenly began lowering his head and looking like a bull about to charge why do you think so You should not think so Think What about asked Prince Andrew with surprise About life about mans destiny It cant be so I myself thought like that and do you know what saved me Freemasonry No dont smile Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect as I thought it was Freemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternal aspects of humanity And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince Andrew He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed from the bonds of State and Church a teaching of equality brotherhood and love Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life all the rest is a dream said Pierre Understand my dear fellow that outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life like you merely trying not to harm others But make our fundamental convictions your own join our brotherhood give yourself up to us let yourself be guided and you will at once feel yourself as I have felt myself a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven said Pierre Prince Andrew looking straight in front of him listened in silence to Pierres words More than once when the noise of the wheels prevented his catching what Pierre said he asked him to repeat it and by the peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrews eyes and by his silence Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said They reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to cross by ferry While the carriage and horses were being placed on it they also stepped on the raft Prince Andrew leaning his arms on the raft railing gazed silently at the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun Well what do you think about it Pierre asked Why are you silent What do I think about it I am listening to you Its all very well You say join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life the destiny of man and the laws which govern the world But who are we Men How is it you know everything Why do I alone not see what you see You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth but I dont see it Pierre interrupted him Do you believe in a future life he asked A future life Prince Andrew repeated but Pierre giving him no time to reply took the repetition for a denial the more readily as he knew Prince Andrews former atheistic convictions You say you cant see a reign of goodness and truth on earth Nor could I and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of everything On earth here on this earth Pierre pointed to the fields there is no truth all is false and evil but in the universe in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth and we who are now the children of earth areeternallychildren of the whole universe Dont I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast harmonious whole Dont I feel that I form one link one step between the lower and higher beings in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the Deitythe Supreme Power if you prefer the termis manifest If I see clearly see that ladder leading from plant to man why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther I feel that I cannot vanish since nothing vanishes in this world but that I shall always exist and always have existed I feel that beyond me and above me there are spirits and that in this world there is truth Yes that is Herders theory said Prince Andrew but it is not that which can convince me dear friendlife and death are what convince What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one bound up with ones own life before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right Prince Andrews voice trembled and he turned away and suddenly that being is seized with pain suffers and ceases to exist Why It cannot be that there is no answer And I believe there is Thats what convinces that is what has convinced me said Prince Andrew Yes yes of course said Pierre isnt that what Im saying No All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the necessity of a future life but this when you go hand in hand with someone and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere and you yourself are left facing that abyss and look in And I have looked in Well thats it then You know that there is a there and there is a Someone There is the future life The Someone isGod Prince Andrew did not reply The carriage and horses had long since been taken off onto the farther bank and reharnessed The sun had sunk half below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near the ferry but Pierre and Andrew to the astonishment of the footmen coachmen and ferrymen still stood on the raft and talked If there is a God and future life there is truth and good and mans highest happiness consists in striving to attain them We must live we must love and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap of earth but have lived and shall live forever there in the Whole said Pierre and he pointed to the sky Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to Pierre and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the sun gleaming on the blue waters There was perfect stillness Pierre became silent The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the current beat softly against it below Prince Andrew felt as if the sound of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierres words whispering It is true believe it He sighed and glanced with a radiant childlike tender look at Pierres face flushed and rapturous but yet shy before his superior friend Yes if it only were so said Prince Andrew However it is time to get on he added and stepping off the raft he looked up at the sky to which Pierre had pointed and for the first time since Austerlitz saw that high everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield and something that had long been slumbering something that was best within him suddenly awoke joyful and youthful in his soul It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop existed within him His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in Prince Andrews life Though outwardly he continued to live in the same old way inwardly he began a new life CHAPTER XIII It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front entrance of the house at Bald Hills As they approached the house Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierres attention to a commotion going on at the back porch A woman bent with age with a wallet on her back and a short longhaired young man in a black garment had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up Two women ran out after them and all four looking round at the carriage ran in dismay up the steps of the back porch Those are Marys Gods folk said Prince Andrew They have mistaken us for my father This is the one matter in which she disobeys him He orders these pilgrims to be driven away but she receives them But what are Gods folk asked Pierre Prince Andrew had no time to answer The servants came out to meet them and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back soon The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments which were always kept in perfect order and readiness for him in his fathers house he himself went to the nursery Let us go and see my sister he said to Pierre when he returned I have not found her yet she is hiding now sitting with her Gods folk It will serve her right she will be confused but you will see her Gods folk Its really very curious What are Gods folk asked Pierre Come and youll see for yourself Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face when they went in In her snug room with lamps burning before the icon stand a young lad with a long nose and long hair wearing a monks cassock sat on the sofa beside her behind a samovar Near them in an armchair sat a thin shriveled old woman with a meek expression on her childlike face Andrew why didnt you warn me said the princess with mild reproach as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens Charmee de vous voir Je suis tres contente de vous voir she said to Pierre as he kissed her hand She had known him as a child and now his friendship with Andrew his misfortune with his wife and above all his kindly simple face disposed her favorably toward him She looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say I like you very much but please dont laugh at my people After exchanging the first greetings they sat down Delighted to see you I am very glad to see you Ah and Ivanushka is here too said Prince Andrew glancing with a smile at the young pilgrim Andrew said Princess Mary imploringly Il faut que vous sachiez que cest une femme said Prince Andrew to Pierre Andrew au nom de Dieu2 Princess Mary repeated You must know that this is a woman 2 For heavens sake It was evident that Prince Andrews ironical tone toward the pilgrims and Princess Marys helpless attempts to protect them were their customary longestablished relations on the matter Mais ma bonne amie said Prince Andrew vous devriez au contraire metre reconnaissante de ce que jexplique a Pierre votre intimite avec ce jeune homme But my dear you ought on the contrary to be grateful to me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young man Really said Pierre gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and seriousness for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him into Ivanushkas face who seeing that she was being spoken about looked round at them all with crafty eyes Princess Marys embarrassment on her peoples account was quite unnecessary They were not in the least abashed The old woman lowering her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers had turned her cup upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it and sat quietly in her armchair though hoping to be offered another cup of tea Ivanushka sipping out of her saucer looked with sly womanish eyes from under her brows at the young men Where have you been To Kiev Prince Andrew asked the old woman I have good sir she answered garrulously Just at Christmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the shrine of the saint And now Im from Kolyazin master where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed And was Ivanushka with you I go by myself benefactor said Ivanushka trying to speak in a bass voice I only came across Pelageya in Yukhnovo Pelageya interrupted her companion she evidently wished to tell what she had seen In Kolyazin master a wonderful blessing has been revealed What is it Some new relics asked Prince Andrew Andrew do leave off said Princess Mary Dont tell him Pelageya No why not my dear why shouldnt I I like him He is kind he is one of Gods chosen hes a benefactor he once gave me ten rubles I remember When I was in Kiev Crazy Cyril says to me hes one of Gods own and goes barefoot summer and winter he says Why are you not going to the right place Go to Kolyazin where a wonderworking icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed On hearing those words I said goodby to the holy folk and went All were silent only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones drawing in her breath So I come master and the people say to me A great blessing has been revealed holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother the Holy Virgin Mother of God All right all right you can tell us afterwards said Princess Mary flushing Let me ask her said Pierre Did you see it yourselves he inquired Oh yes master I was found worthy Such a brightness on the face like the light of heaven and from the blessed Mothers cheek it drops and drops But dear me that must be a fraud said Pierre naively who had listened attentively to the pilgrim Oh master what are you saying exclaimed the horrified Pelageya turning to Princess Mary for support They impose on the people he repeated Lord Jesus Christ exclaimed the pilgrim woman crossing herself Oh dont speak so master There was a general who did not believe and said The monks cheat and as soon as hed said it he went blind And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him and said Believe in me and I will make you whole So he begged Take me to her take me to her Its the real truth Im telling you I saw it myself So he was brought quite blind straight to her and he goes up to her and falls down and says Make me whole says he and Ill give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me I saw it myself master the star is fixed into the icon Well and what do you think He received his sight Its a sin to speak so God will punish you she said admonishingly turning to Pierre How did the star get into the icon Pierre asked And was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general said Prince Andrew with a smile Pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands Oh master master what a sin And you who have a son she began her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red Master what have you said God forgive you And she crossed herself Lord forgive him My dear what does it mean she asked turning to Princess Mary She got up and almost crying began to arrange her wallet She evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things could be said and was at the same time sorry to have now to forgo the charity of this house Now why need you do it said Princess Mary Why did you come to me Come Pelageya I was joking said Pierre Princesse ma parole je nai pas voulu loffenser I did not mean anything I was only joking he said smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense It was all my fault and Andrew was only joking Princess on my word I did not wish to offend her Pelageya stopped doubtfully but in Pierres face there was such a look of sincere penitence and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at her and now at Pierre that she was gradually reassured At nine oclock one morning late in July Gatsbys gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its threenoted horn It was the first time he had called on me though I had gone to two of his parties mounted in his hydroplane and at his urgent invitation made frequent use of his beach Good morning old sport Youre having lunch with me today and I thought wed ride up together He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly Americanthat comes I suppose with the absence of lifting work in youth and even more with the formless grace of our nervous sporadic games This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness He was never quite still there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand He saw me looking with admiration at his car Its pretty isnt it old sport He jumped off to give me a better view Havent you ever seen it before Id seen it Everybody had seen it It was a rich cream colour bright with nickel swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supperboxes and toolboxes and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found to my disappointment that he had little to say So my first impression that he was a person of some undefined consequence had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door And then came that disconcerting ride We hadnt reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramelcoloured suit Look here old sport he broke out surprisingly whats your opinion of me anyhow A little overwhelmed I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves Well Im going to tell you something about my life he interrupted I dont want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls Ill tell you Gods truth His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle Westall dead now I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years It is a family tradition He looked at me sidewaysand I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying He hurried the phrase educated at Oxford or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had bothered him before And with this doubt his whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasnt something a little sinister about him after all What part of the Middle West I inquired casually San Francisco I see My family all died and I came into a good deal of money His voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him convinced me otherwise After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of EuropeParis Venice Romecollecting jewels chiefly rubies hunting big game painting a little things for myself only and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned character leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne Then came the war old sport It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began In the Argonne Forest I took the remains of my machinegun battalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldnt advance We stayed there two days and two nights a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead I was promoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a decorationeven Montenegro little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea Little Montenegro He lifted up the words and nodded at themwith his smile The smile comprehended Montenegros troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegros warm little heart My incredulity was submerged in fascination now it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines He reached in his pocket and a piece of metal slung on a ribbon fell into my palm Thats the one from Montenegro To my astonishment the thing had an authentic look Orderi di Danilo ran the circular legend Montenegro Nicolas Rex Turn it Major Jay Gatsby I read For Valour Extraordinary Heres another thing I always carry A souvenir of Oxford days It was taken in Trinity Quadthe man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires There was Gatsby looking a little not much youngerwith a cricket bat in his hand Then it was all true I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease with their crimsonlighted depths the gnawings of his broken heart Im going to make a big request of you today he said pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction so I thought you ought to know something about me I didnt want you to think I was just some nobody You see I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me He hesitated Youll hear about it this afternoon At lunch No this afternoon I happened to find out that youre taking Miss Baker to tea Do you mean youre in love with Miss Baker No old sport Im not But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter I hadnt the faintest idea what this matter was but I was more annoyed than interested I hadnt asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr Jay Gatsby I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment I was sorry Id ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn He wouldnt say another word His correctness grew on him as we neared the city We passed Port Roosevelt where there was a glimpse of redbelted oceangoing ships and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark undeserted saloons of the fadedgilt nineteenhundreds Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us and I had a glimpse of Mrs Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoriaonly half for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar jugjugspat of a motorcycle and a frantic policeman rode alongside All right old sport called Gatsby We slowed down Taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the mans eyes Right you are agreed the policeman tipping his cap Know you next time Mr Gatsby Excuse me What was that I inquired The picture of Oxford I was able to do the commissioner a favour once and he sends me a Christmas card every year Over the great bridge with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe and I was glad that the sight of Gatsbys splendid car was included in their sombre holiday As we crossed Blackwells Island a limousine passed us driven by a white chauffeur in which sat three modish negroes two bucks and a girl I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry Anything can happen now that weve slid over this bridge I thought anything at all  Even Gatsby could happen without any particular wonder  Roaring noon In a wellfanned Fortysecond Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom talking to another man Mr Carraway this is my friend Mr Wolfshiem A small flatnosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the halfdarkness So I took one look at him said Mr Wolfshiem shaking my hand earnestly and what do you think I did What I inquired politely But evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said All right Katspaugh dont pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth He shut it then and there Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant whereupon Mr Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction Highballs asked the head waiter This is a nice restaurant here said Mr Wolfshiem looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling But I like across the street better Yes highballs agreed Gatsby and then to Mr Wolfshiem Its too hot over there Hot and smallyes said Mr Wolfshiem but full of memories What place is that I asked The old Metropole The old Metropole brooded Mr Wolfshiem gloomily Filled with faces dead and gone Filled with friends gone now forever I cant forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there It was six of us at the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside All right says Rosy and begins to get up and I pulled him down in his chair  Let the bastards come in here if they want you Rosy but dont you so help me move outside this room It was four oclock in the morning then and if wed of raised the blinds wed of seen daylight Did he go I asked innocently Sure he went Mr Wolfshiems nose flashed at me indignantly He turned around in the door and says Dont let that waiter take away my coffee Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away Four of them were electrocuted I said remembering Five with Becker His nostrils turned to me in an interested way I understand youre looking for a business gonnegtion The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling Gatsby answered for me Oh no he exclaimed this isnt the man No Mr Wolfshiem seemed disappointed This is just a friend I told you wed talk about that some other time I beg your pardon said Mr Wolfshiem I had a wrong man A succulent hash arrived and Mr Wolfshiem forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole began to eat with ferocious delicacy His eyes meanwhile roved very slowly all around the roomhe completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind I think that except for my presence he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table Look here old sport said Gatsby leaning toward me Im afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car There was the smile again but this time I held out against it I dont like mysteries I answered and I dont understand why you wont come out frankly and tell me what you want Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker Oh its nothing underhand he assured me Miss Bakers a great sportswoman you know and shed never do anything that wasnt all right Suddenly he looked at his watch jumped up and hurried from the room leaving me with Mr Wolfshiem at the table He has to telephone said Mr Wolfshiem following him with his eyes Fine fellow isnt he Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman Yes Hes an Oggsford man Oh He went to Oggsford College in England You know Oggsford College Ive heard of it Its one of the most famous colleges in the world Have you known Gatsby for a long time I inquired Several years he answered in a gratified way I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour I said to myself Theres the kind of man youd like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister  He paused I see youre looking at my cuff buttons I hadnt been looking at them but I did now They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory Finest specimens of human molars he informed me Well I inspected them Thats a very interesting idea Yeah He flipped his sleeves up under his coat Yeah Gatsbys very careful about women He would never so much as look at a friends wife When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet I have enjoyed my lunch he said and Im going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome Dont hurry Meyer said Gatsby without enthusiasm Mr Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction Youre very polite but I belong to another generation he announced solemnly You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand As for me I am fifty years old and I wont impose myself on you any longer As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling I wondered if I had said anything to offend him He becomes very sentimental sometimes explained Gatsby This is one of his sentimental days Hes quite a character around New Yorka denizen of Broadway Who is he anyhow an actor No A dentist Meyer Wolfshiem No hes a gambler Gatsby hesitated then added coolly Hes the man who fixed the Worlds Series back in 1919 Fixed the Worlds Series I repeated The idea staggered me I remembered of course that the Worlds Series had been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened the end of some inevitable chain It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million peoplewith the singlemindedness of a burglar blowing a safe How did he happen to do that I asked after a minute He just saw the opportunity Why isnt he in jail They cant get him old sport Hes a smart man I insisted on paying the check As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room Come along with me for a minute I said Ive got to say hello to someone When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction Whereve you been he demanded eagerly Daisys furious because you havent called up This is Mr Gatsby Mr Buchanan They shook hands briefly and a strained unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsbys face Howve you been anyhow demanded Tom of me Howd you happen to come up this far to eat Ive been having lunch with Mr Gatsby I turned toward Mr Gatsby but he was no longer there  One October day in nineteenseventeen said Jordan Baker that afternoon sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the teagarden at the Plaza Hotel I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tuttuttuttut in a disapproving way The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fays house She was just eighteen two years older than me and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville She dressed in white and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night Anyways for an hour When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before They were so engrossed in each other that she didnt see me until I was five feet away Hello Jordan she called unexpectedly Please come here I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me because of all the older girls I admired her most She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross to make bandages I was Well then would I tell them that she couldnt come that day The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since His name was Jay Gatsby and I didnt lay eyes on him again for over four yearseven after Id met him on Long Island I didnt realize it was the same man That was nineteenseventeen By the next year I had a few beaux myself and I began to play in tournaments so I didnt see Daisy very often She went with a slightly older crowdwhen she went with anyone at all Wild rumours were circulating about herhow her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas She was effectually prevented but she wasnt on speaking terms with her family for several weeks After that she didnt play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flatfooted shortsighted young men in town who couldnt get into the army at all By the next autumn she was gay again gay as ever She had a début after the armistice and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before He came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars I was a bridesmaid I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dressand as drunk as a monkey She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other  Gratulate me she muttered Never had a drink before but oh how I do enjoy it Whats the matter Daisy I was scared I can tell you Id never seen a girl like that before Here dearies She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls Take em downstairs and give em back to whoever they belong to Tell em all Daisys change her mine Say Daisys change her mine  She began to cryshe cried and cried I rushed out and found her mothers maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath She wouldnt let go of the letter She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball and only let me leave it in the soapdish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow But she didnt say another word We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over Next day at five oclock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months trip to the South Seas I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought Id never seen a girl so mad about her husband If he left the room for a minute shed look around uneasily and say Wheres Tom gone and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight It was touching to see them togetherit made you laugh in a hushed fascinated way That was in August A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car The girl who was with him got into the papers too because her arm was brokenshe was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a year I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle down Daisy was popular in Chicago as you know They moved with a fast crowd all of them young and rich and wild but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation Perhaps because she doesnt drink Its a great advantage not to drink among harddrinking people You can hold your tongue and moreover you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they dont see or care Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at alland yet theres something in that voice of hers  Well about six weeks ago she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years It was when I asked youdo you rememberif you knew Gatsby in West Egg After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up and said What Gatsby and when I described himI was half asleepshe said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know It wasnt until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car  When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and the clear voices of children already gathered like crickets on the grass rose through the hot twilight Im the Sheik of Araby Your love belongs to me At night when youre asleep Into your tent Ill creep It was a strange coincidence I said But it wasnt a coincidence at all Why not Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night He came alive to me delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour He wants to know continued Jordan if youll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over The modesty of the demand shook me He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual mothsso that he could come over some afternoon to a strangers garden Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing Hes afraid hes waited so long He thought you might be offended You see hes regular tough underneath it all Something worried me Why didnt he ask you to arrange a meeting He wants her to see his house she explained And your house is right next door Oh I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties some night went on Jordan but she never did Then he began asking people casually if they knew her and I was the first one he found It was that night he sent for me at his dance and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it Of course I immediately suggested a luncheon in New Yorkand I thought hed go mad  I dont want to do anything out of the way he kept saying I want to see her right next door When I said you were a particular friend of Toms he started to abandon the whole idea He doesnt know very much about Tom though he says hes read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisys name It was dark now and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordans golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner Suddenly I wasnt thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this clean hard limited person who dealt in universal scepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement There are only the pursued the pursuing the busy and the tired And Daisy ought to have something in her life murmured Jordan to me Does she want to see Gatsby Shes not to know about it Gatsby doesnt want her to know Youre just supposed to invite her to tea We passed a barrier of dark trees and then the façade of FiftyNinth Street a block of delicate pale light beamed down into the park Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me tightening my arms Her wan scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again closer this time to my face V When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire Two oclock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires Turning a corner I saw that it was Gatsbys house lit from tower to cellar At first I thought it was another party a wild rout that had resolved itself into hideandgoseek or sardinesinthebox with all the house thrown open to the game But there wasnt a sound Only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn Your place looks like the Worlds Fair I said Does it He turned his eyes toward it absently I have been glancing into some of the rooms Lets go to Coney Island old sport In my car Its too late Well suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool I havent made use of it all summer Ive got to go to bed All right He waited looking at me with suppressed eagerness I talked with Miss Baker I said after a moment Im going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea Oh thats all right he said carelessly I dont want to put you to any trouble What day would suit you What day would suit you he corrected me quickly I dont want to put you to any trouble you see How about the day after tomorrow He considered for a moment Then with reluctance I want to get the grass cut he said We both looked down at the grassthere was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker wellkept expanse of his began I suspected that he meant my grass Theres another little thing he said uncertainly and hesitated Would you rather put it off for a few days I asked Oh it isnt about that At least He fumbled with a series of beginnings Why I thoughtwhy look here old sport you dont make much money do you Not very much This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently I thought you didnt if youll pardon myyou see I carry on a little business on the side a sort of side line you understand And I thought that if you dont make very muchYoure selling bonds arent you old sport Trying to Well this would interest you It wouldnt take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life But because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered I had no choice except to cut him off there Ive got my hands full I said Im much obliged but I couldnt take on any more work You wouldnt have to do any business with Wolfshiem Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the gonnegtion mentioned at lunch but I assured him he was wrong He waited a moment longer hoping Id begin a conversation but I was too absorbed to be responsive so he went unwillingly home The evening had made me lightheaded and happy I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door So I dont know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he glanced into rooms while his house blazed gaudily on I called up Daisy from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea Dont bring Tom I warned her What Dont bring Tom Who is Tom she asked innocently The day agreed upon was pouring rain At eleven oclock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawnmower tapped at my front door and said that Mr Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers The flowers were unnecessary for at two oclock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsbys with innumerable receptacles to contain it An hour later the front door opened nervously and Gatsby in a white flannel suit silver shirt and goldcoloured tie hurried in He was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes Is everything all right he asked immediately The grass looks fine if thats what you mean What grass he inquired blankly Oh the grass in the yard He looked out the window at it but judging from his expression I dont believe he saw a thing Looks very good he remarked vaguely One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four I think it was The Journal Have you got everything you need in the shape ofof tea I took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop Will they do I asked Of course of course Theyre fine and he added hollowly  old sport The rain cooled about halfpast three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clays Economics starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home Whys that Nobodys coming to tea Its too late He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere I cant wait all day Dont be silly its just two minutes to four He sat down miserably as if I had pushed him and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane We both jumped up and a little harrowed myself I went out into the yard Under the dripping bare lilactrees a large open car was coming up the drive It stopped Daisys face tipped sideways beneath a threecornered lavender hat looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile Is this absolutely where you live my dearest one The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain I had to follow the sound of it for a moment up and down with my ear alone before any words came through A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car Are you in love with me she said low in my ear or why did I have to come alone Thats the secret of Castle Rackrent Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour Come back in an hour Ferdie Then in a grave murmur His name is Ferdie Does the gasoline affect his nose I dont think so she said innocently Why We went in To my overwhelming surprise the livingroom was deserted Well thats funny I exclaimed Whats funny She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door I went out and opened it Gatsby pale as death with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the livingroom It wasnt a bit funny Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain For half a minute there wasnt a sound Then from the livingroom I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisys voice on a clear artificial note I certainly am awfully glad to see you again A pause it endured horribly I had nothing to do in the hall so I went into the room Gatsby his hands still in his pockets was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease even of boredom His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair Weve met before muttered Gatsby His eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place Then he sat down rigidly his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand Im sorry about the clock he said My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn I couldnt muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head Its an old clock I told them idiotically I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor We havent met for many years said Daisy her voice as matteroffact as it could ever be Five years next November The automatic quality of Gatsbys answer set us all back at least another minute I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes However as calmness wasnt an end in itself I made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet Where are you going demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm Ill be back Ive got to speak to you about something before you go He followed me wildly into the kitchen closed the door and whispered Oh God in a miserable way Whats the matter This is a terrible mistake he said shaking his head from side to side a terrible terrible mistake Youre just embarrassed thats all and luckily I added Daisys embarrassed too Shes embarrassed he repeated incredulously Just as much as you are Dont talk so loud Youre acting like a little boy I broke out impatiently Not only that but youre rude Daisys sitting in there all alone He raised his hand to stop my words looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room I walked out the back wayjust as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour beforeand ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain Once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn wellshaved by Gatsbys gardener abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsbys enormous house so I stared at it like Kant at his church steeple for half an hour A brewer had built it early in the period craze a decade before and there was a story that hed agreed to pay five years taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Familyhe went into an immediate decline His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door Americans while willing even eager to be serfs have always been obstinate about being peasantry After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocers automobile rounded Gatsbys drive with the raw material for his servants dinnerI felt sure he wouldnt eat a spoonful A maid began opening the upper windows of his house appeared momentarily in each and leaning from the large central bay spat meditatively into the garden It was time I went back While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too I went inafter making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stovebut I dont believe they heard a sound They were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air and every vestige of embarrassment was gone Daisys face was smeared with tears and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding He literally glowed without a word or a gesture of exultation a new wellbeing radiated from him and filled the little room Oh hello old sport he said as if he hadnt seen me for years I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands Its stopped raining Has it When he realized what I was talking about that there were twinklebells of sunshine in the room he smiled like a weather man like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light and repeated the news to Daisy What do you think of that Its stopped raining Im glad Jay Her throat full of aching grieving beauty told only of her unexpected joy I want you and Daisy to come over to my house he said Id like to show her around Youre sure you want me to come Absolutely old sport Daisy went upstairs to wash her facetoo late I thought with humiliation of my towelswhile Gatsby and I waited on the lawn My house looks well doesnt it he demanded See how the whole front of it catches the light I agreed that it was splendid Yes His eyes went over it every arched door and square tower It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it I thought you inherited your money I did old sport he said automatically but I lost most of it in the big panicthe panic of the war I think he hardly knew what he was saying for when I asked him what business he was in he answered Thats my affair before he realized that it wasnt an appropriate reply Oh Ive been in several things he corrected himself I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business But Im not in either one now He looked at me with more attention Do you mean youve been thinking over what I proposed the other night Before I could answer Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight That huge place there she cried pointing Do you like it I love it but I dont see how you live there all alone I keep it always full of interesting people night and day People who do interesting things Celebrated people Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky admired the gardens the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kissmeatthegate It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette musicrooms and Restoration Salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through As Gatsby closed the door of the Merton College Library I could have sworn I heard the owleyed man break into ghostly laughter We went upstairs through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers through dressingrooms and poolrooms and bathrooms with sunken bathsintruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor It was Mr Klipspringer the boarder I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning Finally we came to Gatsbys own apartment a bedroom and a bath and an Adams study where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall He hadnt once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her wellloved eyes Sometimes too he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs His bedroom was the simplest room of allexcept where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold Daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh Its the funniest thing old sport he said hilariously I cantWhen I try to He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence He had been full of the idea so long dreamed it right through to the end waited with his teeth set so to speak at an inconceivable pitch of intensity Now in the reaction he was running down like an overwound clock Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressinggowns and ties and his shirts piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high Ive got a man in England who buys me clothes He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season spring and fall He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in manycoloured disarray While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted highershirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and applegreen and lavender and faint orange with monograms of indian blue Suddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily Theyre such beautiful shirts she sobbed her voice muffled in the thick folds It makes me sad because Ive never seen suchsuch beautiful shirts before  After the house we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowersbut outside Gatsbys window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound If it wasnt for the mist we could see your home across the bay said Gatsby You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her almost touching her It had seemed as close as a star to the moon Now it was again a green light on a dock His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one I began to walk about the room examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me hung on the wall over his desk Whos this That Thats Mr Dan Cody old sport The name sounded faintly familiar Hes dead now He used to be my best friend years ago There was a small picture of Gatsby also in yachting costume on the bureauGatsby with his head thrown back defiantlytaken apparently when he was about eighteen I adore it exclaimed Daisy The pompadour You never told me you had a pompadouror a yacht Look at this said Gatsby quickly Heres a lot of clippingsabout you They stood side by side examining it I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver Yes  Well I cant talk now  I cant talk now old sport  I said a small town  He must know what a small town is  Well hes no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town  He rang off Come here quick cried Daisy at the window The rain was still falling but the darkness had parted in the west and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea Look at that she whispered and then after a moment Id like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around I tried to go then but they wouldnt hear of it perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone I know what well do said Gatsby well have Klipspringer play the piano He went out of the room calling Ewing and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed slightly worn young man with shellrimmed glasses and scanty blond hair He was now decently clothed in a sport shirt open at the neck sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue Did we interrupt your exercise inquired Daisy politely I was asleep cried Mr Klipspringer in a spasm of embarrassment That is Id been asleep Then I got up  Klipspringer plays the piano said Gatsby cutting him off Dont you Ewing old sport I dont play well I donthardly play at all Im all out of prac Well go downstairs interrupted Gatsby He flipped a switch The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light In the musicroom Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano He lit Daisys cigarette from a trembling match and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall When Klipspringer had played The Love Nest he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom Im all out of practice you see I told you I couldnt play Im all out of prac Dont talk so much old sport commanded Gatsby Play In the morning In the evening Aint we got fun Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound All the lights were going on in West Egg now the electric trains mencarrying were plunging home through the rain from New York It was the hour of a profound human change and excitement was generating on the air One things sure and nothings surer The rich get richer and the poor getchildren In the meantime In between time As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsbys face as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness Almost five years There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreamsnot through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion It had gone beyond her beyond everything He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion adding to it all the time decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart As I watched him he adjusted himself a little visibly His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating feverish warmth because it couldnt be overdreamedthat voice was a deathless song They had forgotten me but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand Gatsby didnt know me now at all I looked once more at them and they looked back at me remotely possessed by intense life Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain leaving them there together VI About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsbys door and asked him if he had anything to say Anything to say about what inquired Gatsby politely Whyany statement to give out It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsbys name around his office in a connection which he either wouldnt reveal or didnt fully understand This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out to see It was a random shot and yet the reporters instinct was right Gatsbys notoriety spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news Contemporary legends such as the underground pipeline to Canada attached themselves to him and there was one persistent story that he didnt live in a house at all but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota isnt easy to say James Gatzthat was really or at least legally his name He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his careerwhen he saw Dan Codys yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat pulled out to the Tuolomee and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour I suppose hed had the name ready for a long time even then His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm peoplehis imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg Long Island sprang from his Platonic conception of himself He was a son of Goda phrase which if it means anything means just thatand he must be about His Fathers business the service of a vast vulgar and meretricious beauty So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeenyearold boy would be likely to invent and to this conception he was faithful to the end For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clamdigger and a salmonfisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed His brown hardening body lived naturally through the halffierce halflazy work of the bracing days He knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them of young virgins because they were ignorant of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming selfabsorption he took for granted But his heart was in a constant turbulent riot The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairys wing An instinct toward his future glory had led him some months before to the small Lutheran College of St Olafs in southern Minnesota He stayed there two weeks dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny to destiny itself and despising the janitors work with which he was to pay his way through Then he drifted back to Lake Superior and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Codys yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore Cody was fifty years old then a product of the Nevada silver fields of the Yukon of every rush for metal since seventyfive The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of softmindedness and suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye the newspaper woman played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht were common property of the turgid journalism in 1902 He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatzs destiny in Little Girl Bay To young Gatz resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world I suppose he smiled at Codyhe had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled At any rate Cody asked him a few questions one of them elicited the brand new name and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat six pairs of white duck trousers and a yachting cap And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too He was employed in a vague personal capacitywhile he remained with Cody he was in turn steward mate skipper secretary and even jailor for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby The arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the Continent It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsbys bedroom a grey florid man with a hard empty facethe pioneer debauchee who during one phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone And it was from Cody that he inherited moneya legacy of twentyfive thousand dollars He didnt get it He never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye He was left with his singularly appropriate education the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man  He told me all this very much later but Ive put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents which werent even faintly true Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him So I take advantage of this short halt while Gatsby so to speak caught his breath to clear this set of misconceptions away It was a halt too in my association with his affairs For several weeks I didnt see him or hear his voice on the phonemostly I was in New York trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile auntbut finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon I hadnt been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink I was startled naturally but the really surprising thing was that it hadnt happened before They were a party of three on horsebackTom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown ridinghabit who had been there previously Im delighted to see you said Gatsby standing on his porch Im delighted that you dropped in As though they cared Sit right down Have a cigarette or a cigar He walked around the room quickly ringing bells Ill have something to drink for you in just a minute He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for Mr Sloane wanted nothing A lemonade No thanks A little champagne Nothing at all thanks  Im sorry Did you have a nice ride Very good roads around here I suppose the automobiles Yeah Moved by an irresistible impulse Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger I believe weve met somewhere before Mr Buchanan Oh yes said Tom gruffly polite but obviously not remembering So we did I remember very well About two weeks ago Thats right You were with Nick here I know your wife continued Gatsby almost aggressively That so Tom turned to me You live near here Nick Next door That so Mr Sloane didnt enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair the woman said nothing eitheruntil unexpectedly after two highballs she became cordial Well all come over to your next party Mr Gatsby she suggested What do you say Certainly Id be delighted to have you Be ver nice said Mr Sloane without gratitude Wellthink ought to be starting home Please dont hurry Gatsby urged them He had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom Why dont youwhy dont you stay for supper I wouldnt be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York You come to supper with me said the lady enthusiastically Both of you This included me Mr Sloane got to his feet Come along he saidbut to her only I mean it she insisted Id love to have you Lots of room Gatsby looked at me questioningly He wanted to go and he didnt see that Mr Sloane had determined he shouldnt Im afraid I wont be able to I said Well you come she urged concentrating on Gatsby Mr Sloane murmured something close to her ear We wont be late if we start now she insisted aloud I havent got a horse said Gatsby I used to ride in the army but Ive never bought a horse Ill have to follow you in my car Excuse me for just a minute The rest of us walked out on the porch where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside My God I believe the mans coming said Tom Doesnt he know she doesnt want him She says she does want him She has a big dinner party and he wont know a soul there He frowned I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy By God I may be oldfashioned in my ideas but women run around too much these days to suit me They meet all kinds of crazy fish Suddenly Mr Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses Come on said Mr Sloane to Tom were late Weve got to go And then to me Tell him we couldnt wait will you Tom and I shook hands the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisys running around alone for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsbys party Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressivenessit stands out in my memory from Gatsbys other parties that summer There were the same people or at least the same sort of people the same profusion of champagne the same manycoloured manykeyed commotion but I felt an unpleasantness in the air a pervading harshness that hadnt been there before Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself with its own standards and its own great figures second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so and now I was looking at it again through Daisys eyes It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds Daisys voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat These things excite me so she whispered If you want to kiss me any time during the evening Nick just let me know and Ill be glad to arrange it for you Just mention my name Or present a green card Im giving out green Look around suggested Gatsby Im looking around Im having a marvellous You must see the faces of many people youve heard about Toms arrogant eyes roamed the crowd We dont go around very much he said in fact I was just thinking I dont know a soul here Perhaps you know that lady Gatsby indicated a gorgeous scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a whiteplum tree Tom and Daisy stared with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies Shes lovely said Daisy The man bending over her is her director He took them ceremoniously from group to group Mrs Buchanan  and Mr Buchanan After an instants hesitation he added the polo player Oh no objected Tom quickly not me But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained the polo player for the rest of the evening Ive never met so many celebrities Daisy exclaimed I liked that manwhat was his namewith the sort of blue nose Gatsby identified him adding that he was a small producer Well I liked him anyhow Id a little rather not be the polo player said Tom pleasantly Id rather look at all these famous people inin oblivion Daisy and Gatsby danced I remember being surprised by his graceful conservative foxtrotI had never seen him dance before Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden In case theres a fire or a flood she explained or any act of God Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together Do you mind if I eat with some people over here he said A fellows getting off some funny stuff Go ahead answered Daisy genially and if you want to take down any addresses heres my little gold pencil  She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was common but pretty and I knew that except for the halfhour shed been alone with Gatsby she wasnt having a good time We were at a particularly tipsy table That was my faultGatsby had been called to the phone and Id enjoyed these same people only two weeks before But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now How do you feel Miss Baedeker The girl addressed was trying unsuccessfully to slump against my shoulder At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes Wha A massive and lethargic woman who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow spoke in Miss Baedekers defence Oh shes all right now When shes had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that I tell her she ought to leave it alone I do leave it alone affirmed the accused hollowly We heard you yelling so I said to Doc Civet here Theres somebody that needs your help Doc  Shes much obliged Im sure said another friend without gratitude but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool mumbled Miss Baedeker They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey Then you ought to leave it alone countered Doctor Civet Speak for yourself cried Miss Baedeker violently Your hand shakes I wouldnt let you operate on me It was like that Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the movingpicture director and his Star They were still under the whiteplum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek I like her said Daisy I think shes lovely But the rest offended herand inarguably because it wasnt a gesture but an emotion She was appalled by West Egg this unprecedented place that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing villageappalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car It was dark here in front only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressingroom blind above gave way to another shadow an indefinite procession of shadows who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass Who is this Gatsby anyhow demanded Tom suddenly Some big bootlegger Whered you hear that I inquired I didnt hear it I imagined it A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers you know Not Gatsby I said shortly He was silent for a moment The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet Well he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisys fur collar At least they are more interesting than the people we know she said with an effort You didnt look so interested Well I was Tom laughed and turned to me Did you notice Daisys face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky rhythmic whisper bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly following it in a way contralto voices have and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air Lots of people come who havent been invited she said suddenly That girl hadnt been invited They simply force their way in and hes too polite to object Id like to know who he is and what he does insisted Tom And I think Ill make a point of finding out I can tell you right now she answered He owned some drugstores a lot of drugstores He built them up himself The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive Good night Nick said Daisy Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where Three OClock in the Morning a neat sad little waltz of that year was drifting out the open door After all in the very casualness of Gatsbys party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby one moment of magical encounter would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion I stayed late that night Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up chilled and exalted from the black beach until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face and his eyes were bright and tired She didnt like it he said immediately Of course she did She didnt like it he insisted She didnt have a good time He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression I feel far away from her he said Its hard to make her understand You mean about the dance The dance He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers Old sport the dance is unimportant He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say I never loved you After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken One of them was that after she was free they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her housejust as if it were five years ago And she doesnt understand he said She used to be able to understand Wed sit for hours He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers I wouldnt ask too much of her I ventured You cant repeat the past Cant repeat the past he cried incredulously Why of course you can He looked around him wildly as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house just out of reach of his hand Im going to fix everything just the way it was before he said nodding determinedly Shell see He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover something some idea of himself perhaps that had gone into loving Daisy His life had been confused and disordered since then but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly he could find out what that thing was One autumn night five years before they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight They stopped here and turned toward each other Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the treeshe could climb to it if he climbed alone and once there he could suck on the pap of life gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder His heart beat faster as Daisys white face came up to his own He knew that when he kissed this girl and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath his mind would never romp again like the mind of God So he waited listening for a moment longer to the tuningfork that had been struck upon a star Then he kissed her At his lips touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete Through all he said even through his appalling sentimentality I was reminded of somethingan elusive rhythm a fragment of lost words that I had heard somewhere a long time ago For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb mans as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air But they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever VII It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday nightand as obscurely as it had begun his career as Trimalchio was over Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away Wondering if he were sick I went over to find outan unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door Is Mr Gatsby sick Nope After a pause he added sir in a dilatory grudging way I hadnt seen him around and I was rather worried Tell him Mr Carraway came over Who he demanded rudely Carraway Carraway All right Ill tell him Abruptly he slammed the door My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others who never went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty and the general opinion in the village was that the new people werent servants at all Next day Gatsby called me on the phone Going away I inquired No old sport I hear you fired all your servants I wanted somebody who wouldnt gossip Daisy comes over quite oftenin the afternoons So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes Theyre some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for Theyre all brothers and sisters They used to run a small hotel I see He was calling up at Daisys requestwould I come to lunch at her house tomorrow Miss Baker would be there Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming Something was up And yet I couldnt believe that they would choose this occasion for a sceneespecially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden The next day was broiling almost the last certainly the warmest of the summer As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist and then as her newspaper dampened under her fingers lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry Her pocketbook slapped to the floor Oh my she gasped I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her holding it at arms length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon itbut everyone near by including the woman suspected me just the same Hot said the conductor to familiar faces Some weather Is it hot enough for you Is it hot Is it My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart  Through the hall of the Buchanans house blew a faint wind carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door The masters body roared the butler into the mouthpiece Im sorry madame but we cant furnish itits far too hot to touch this noon What he really said was Yes  Yes  Ill see He set down the receiver and came toward us glistening slightly to take our stiff straw hats Madame expects you in the salon he cried needlessly indicating the direction In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life The room shadowed well with awnings was dark and cool Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans We cant move they said together Jordans fingers powdered white over their tan rested for a moment in mine And Mr Thomas Buchanan the athlete I inquired Simultaneously I heard his voice gruff muffled husky at the hall telephone Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes Daisy watched him and laughed her sweet exciting laugh a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air The rumour is whispered Jordan that thats Toms girl on the telephone We were silent The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance Very well then I wont sell you the car at all  Im under no obligations to you at all  and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time I wont stand that at all Holding down the receiver said Daisy cynically No hes not I assured her Its a bonafide deal I happen to know about it Tom flung open the door blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body and hurried into the room Mr Gatsby He put out his broad flat hand with wellconcealed dislike Im glad to see you sir  Nick  Make us a cold drink cried Daisy As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth You know I love you she murmured You forget theres a lady present said Jordan Daisy looked around doubtfully You kiss Nick too What a low vulgar girl I dont care cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room Blessed precious she crooned holding out her arms Come to your own mother that loves you The child relinquished by the nurse rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mothers dress The blessed precious Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair Stand up now and sayHowdedo Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise I dont think he had ever really believed in its existence before I got dressed before luncheon said the child turning eagerly to Daisy Thats because your mother wanted to show you off Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck You dream you You absolute little dream Yes admitted the child calmly Aunt Jordans got on a white dress too How do you like mothers friends Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby Do you think theyre pretty Wheres Daddy She doesnt look like her father explained Daisy She looks like me Shes got my hair and shape of the face Daisy sat back upon the couch The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand Come Pammy Goodbye sweetheart With a reluctant backward glance the welldisciplined child held to her nurses hand and was pulled out the door just as Tom came back preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice Gatsby took up his drink They certainly look cool he said with visible tension We drank in long greedy swallows I read somewhere that the suns getting hotter every year said Tom genially It seems that pretty soon the earths going to fall into the sunor wait a minuteits just the oppositethe suns getting colder every year Come outside he suggested to Gatsby Id like you to have a look at the place I went with them out to the veranda On the green Sound stagnant in the heat one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea Gatsbys eyes followed it momentarily he raised his hand and pointed across the bay Im right across from you So you are Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dogdays alongshore Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles Theres sport for you said Tom nodding Id like to be out there with him for about an hour We had luncheon in the diningroom darkened too against the heat and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale Whatll we do with ourselves this afternoon cried Daisy and the day after that and the next thirty years Dont be morbid Jordan said Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall But its so hot insisted Daisy on the verge of tears and everythings so confused Lets all go to town Her voice struggled on through the heat beating against it moulding its senselessness into forms Ive heard of making a garage out of a stable Tom was saying to Gatsby but Im the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage Who wants to go to town demanded Daisy insistently Gatsbys eyes floated toward her Ah she cried you look so cool Their eyes met and they stared together at each other alone in space With an effort she glanced down at the table You always look so cool she repeated She had told him that she loved him and Tom Buchanan saw He was astounded His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago You resemble the advertisement of the man she went on innocently You know the advertisement of the man All right broke in Tom quickly Im perfectly willing to go to town Come onwere all going to town He got up his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife No one moved Come on His temper cracked a little Whats the matter anyhow If were going to town lets start His hand trembling with his effort at selfcontrol bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale Daisys voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive Are we just going to go she objected Like this Arent we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first Everybody smoked all through lunch Oh lets have fun she begged him Its too hot to fuss He didnt answer Have it your own way she said Come on Jordan They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky Gatsby started to speak changed his mind but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly Have you got your stables here asked Gatsby with an effort About a quarter of a mile down the road Oh A pause I dont see the idea of going to town broke out Tom savagely Women get these notions in their heads Shall we take anything to drink called Daisy from an upper window Ill get some whisky answered Tom He went inside Gatsby turned to me rigidly I cant say anything in his house old sport Shes got an indiscreet voice I remarked Its full of I hesitated Her voice is full of money he said suddenly That was it Id never understood before It was full of moneythat was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it the jingle of it the cymbals song of it  High in a white palace the kings daughter the golden girl  Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms Shall we all go in my car suggested Gatsby He felt the hot green leather of the seat I ought to have left it in the shade Is it standard shift demanded Tom Yes Well you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby I dont think theres much gas he objected Plenty of gas said Tom boisterously He looked at the gauge And if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore You can buy anything at a drugstore nowadays A pause followed this apparently pointless remark Daisy looked at Tom frowning and an indefinable expression at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable as if I had only heard it described in words passed over Gatsbys face Come on Daisy said Tom pressing her with his hand toward Gatsbys car Ill take you in this circus wagon He opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm You take Nick and Jordan Well follow you in the coupé She walked close to Gatsby touching his coat with her hand Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsbys car Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind Did you see that demanded Tom See what He looked at me keenly realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along You think Im pretty dumb dont you he suggested Perhaps I am but I have aalmost a second sight sometimes that tells me what to do Maybe you dont believe that but science He paused The immediate contingency overtook him pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss Ive made a small investigation of this fellow he continued I could have gone deeper if Id known Do you mean youve been to a medium inquired Jordan humorously What Confused he stared at us as we laughed A medium About Gatsby About Gatsby No I havent I said Id been making a small investigation of his past And you found he was an Oxford man said Jordan helpfully An Oxford man He was incredulous Like hell he is He wears a pink suit Nevertheless hes an Oxford man Oxford New Mexico snorted Tom contemptuously or something like that Listen Tom If youre such a snob why did you invite him to lunch demanded Jordan crossly Daisy invited him she knew him before we were marriedGod knows where We were all irritable now with the fading ale and aware of it we drove for a while in silence Then as Doctor T J Eckleburgs faded eyes came into sight down the road I remembered Gatsbys caution about gasoline Weve got enough to get us to town said Tom But theres a garage right here objected Jordan I dont want to get stalled in this baking heat Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilsons sign After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed holloweyed at the car Lets have some gas cried Tom roughly What do you think we stopped forto admire the view Im sick said Wilson without moving Been sick all day Whats the matter Im all run down Well shall I help myself Tom demanded You sounded well enough on the phone With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and breathing hard unscrewed the cap of the tank In the sunlight his face was green I didnt mean to interrupt your lunch he said But I need money pretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car How do you like this one inquired Tom I bought it last week Its a nice yellow one said Wilson as he strained at the handle Like to buy it Big chance Wilson smiled faintly No but I could make some money on the other What do you want money for all of a sudden Ive been here too long I want to get away My wife and I want to go West Your wife does exclaimed Tom startled Shes been talking about it for ten years He rested for a moment against the pump shading his eyes And now shes going whether she wants to or not Im going to get her away The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand What do I owe you demanded Tom harshly I just got wised up to something funny the last two days remarked Wilson Thats why I want to get away Thats why I been bothering you about the car What do I owe you Dollar twenty The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadnt alighted on Tom He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick I stared at him and then at Tom who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour beforeand it occurred to me that there was no difference between men in intelligence or race so profound as the difference between the sick and the well Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty unforgivably guiltyas if he had just got some poor girl with child Ill let you have that car said Tom Ill send it over tomorrow afternoon That locality was always vaguely disquieting even in the broad glare of afternoon and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived after a moment that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture Her expression was curiously familiarit was an expression I had often seen on womens faces but on Myrtle Wilsons face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes wide with jealous terror were fixed not on Tom but on Jordan Baker whom she took to be his wife  There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic His wife and his mistress until an hour ago secure and inviolate were slipping precipitately from his control Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour until among the spidery girders of the elevated we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool suggested Jordan I love New York on summer afternoons when everyones away Theres something very sensuous about itoverripe as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands The word sensuous had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside Where are we going she cried How about the movies Its so hot she complained You go Well ride around and meet you after With an effort her wit rose faintly Well meet you on some corner Ill be the man smoking two cigarettes We cant argue about it here Tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us You follow me to the south side of Central Park in front of the Plaza Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight I think he was afraid they would dart down a sidestreet and out of his life forever But they didnt And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me though I have a sharp physical memory that in the course of it my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back The notion originated with Daisys suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths and then assumed more tangible form as a place to have a mint julep Each of us said over and over that it was a crazy ideawe all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought or pretended to think that we were being very funny  The room was large and stifling and though it was already four oclock opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us fixing her hair Its a swell suite whispered Jordan respectfully and everyone laughed Open another window commanded Daisy without turning around There arent any more Well wed better telephone for an axe The thing to do is to forget about the heat said Tom impatiently You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table Why not let her alone old sport remarked Gatsby Youre the one that wanted to come to town There was a moment of silence The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor whereupon Jordan whispered Excuse mebut this time no one laughed Ill pick it up I offered Ive got it Gatsby examined the parted string muttered Hum in an interested way and tossed the book on a chair Thats a great expression of yours isnt it said Tom sharply What is All this old sport business Whered you pick that up Now see here Tom said Daisy turning around from the mirror if youre going to make personal remarks I wont stay here a minute Call up and order some ice for the mint julep As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohns Wedding March from the ballroom below Imagine marrying anybody in this heat cried Jordan dismally StillI was married in the middle of June Daisy remembered Louisville in June Somebody fainted Who was it fainted Tom Biloxi he answered shortly A man named Biloxi Blocks Biloxi and he made boxesthats a factand he was from Biloxi Tennessee They carried him into my house appended Jordan because we lived just two doors from the church And he stayed three weeks until Daddy told him he had to get out The day after he left Daddy died After a moment she added There wasnt any connection I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis I remarked That was his cousin I knew his whole family history before he left He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window followed by intermittent cries of Yeaeaea and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began Were getting old said Daisy If we were young wed rise and dance Remember Biloxi Jordan warned her Whered you know him Tom Biloxi He concentrated with an effort I didnt know him He was a friend of Daisys He was not she denied Id never seen him before He came down in the private car Well he said he knew you He said he was raised in Louisville Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him Jordan smiled He was probably bumming his way home He told me he was president of your class at Yale Tom and I looked at each other blankly Biloxi First place we didnt have any president Gatsbys foot beat a short restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly By the way Mr Gatsby I understand youre an Oxford man Not exactly Oh yes I understand you went to Oxford YesI went there A pause Then Toms voice incredulous and insulting You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven Another pause A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his thank you and the soft closing of the door This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last I told you I went there said Gatsby I heard you but Id like to know when It was in nineteennineteen I only stayed five months Thats why I cant really call myself an Oxford man Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief But we were all looking at Gatsby It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice he continued We could go to any of the universities in England or France I wanted to get up and slap him on the back I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that Id experienced before Daisy rose smiling faintly and went to the table Open the whisky Tom she ordered and Ill make you a mint julep Then you wont seem so stupid to yourself  Look at the mint Wait a minute snapped Tom I want to ask Mr Gatsby one more question Go on Gatsby said politely What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content He isnt causing a row Daisy looked desperately from one to the other Youre causing a row Please have a little selfcontrol Selfcontrol repeated Tom incredulously I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife Well if thats the idea you can count me out  Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next theyll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization Were all white here murmured Jordan I know Im not very popular I dont give big parties I suppose youve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friendsin the modern world Angry as I was as we all were I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth The transition from libertine to prig was so complete Ive got something to tell you old sport began Gatsby But Daisy guessed at his intention Please dont she interrupted helplessly Please lets all go home Why dont we all go home Thats a good idea I got up Come on Tom Nobody wants a drink I want to know what Mr Gatsby has to tell me Your wife doesnt love you said Gatsby Shes never loved you She loves me You must be crazy exclaimed Tom automatically Gatsby sprang to his feet vivid with excitement She never loved you do you hear he cried She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me It was a terrible mistake but in her heart she never loved anyone except me At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remainas though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions Sit down Daisy Toms voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note Whats been going on I want to hear all about it I told you whats been going on said Gatsby Going on for five yearsand you didnt know Tom turned to Daisy sharply Youve been seeing this fellow for five years Not seeing said Gatsby No we couldnt meet But both of us loved each other all that time old sport and you didnt know I used to laugh sometimesbut there was no laughter in his eyesto think that you didnt know Ohthats all Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair Youre crazy he exploded I cant speak about what happened five years ago because I didnt know Daisy thenand Ill be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door But all the rest of thats a God damned lie Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now No said Gatsby shaking his head She does though The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesnt know what shes doing He nodded sagely And whats more I love Daisy too Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself but I always come back and in my heart I love her all the time Youre revolting said Daisy She turned to me and her voice dropping an octave lower filled the room with thrilling scorn Do you know why we left Chicago Im surprised that they didnt treat you to the story of that little spree Gatsby walked over and stood beside her Daisy thats all over now he said earnestly It doesnt matter any more Just tell him the truththat you never loved himand its all wiped out forever She looked at him blindly Whyhow could I love himpossibly You never loved him She hesitated Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal as though she realized at last what she was doingand as though she had never all along intended doing anything at all But it was done now It was too late I never loved him she said with perceptible reluctance Not at Kapiolani demanded Tom suddenly No From the ballroom beneath muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry There was a husky tenderness in his tone  Daisy Please dont Her voice was cold but the rancour was gone from it She looked at Gatsby There Jay she saidbut her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet Oh you want too much she cried to Gatsby I love you nowisnt that enough I cant help whats past She began to sob helplessly I did love him oncebut I loved you too Gatsbys eyes opened and closed You loved me too he repeated Even thats a lie said Tom savagely She didnt know you were alive Whytheres things between Daisy and me that youll never know things that neither of us can ever forget The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby I want to speak to Daisy alone he insisted Shes all excited now Even alone I cant say I never loved Tom she admitted in a pitiful voice It wouldnt be true Of course it wouldnt agreed Tom She turned to her husband As if it mattered to you she said Of course it matters Im going to take better care of you from now on You dont understand said Gatsby with a touch of panic Youre not going to take care of her any more Im not Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed He could afford to control himself now Whys that Daisys leaving you Nonsense I am though she said with a visible effort Shes not leaving me Toms words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby Certainly not for a common swindler whod have to steal the ring he put on her finger I wont stand this cried Daisy Oh please lets get out Who are you anyhow broke out Tom Youre one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiemthat much I happen to know Ive made a little investigation into your affairsand Ill carry it further tomorrow You can suit yourself about that old sport said Gatsby steadily I found out what your drugstores were He turned to us and spoke rapidly He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of sidestreet drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter Thats one of his little stunts I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him and I wasnt far wrong What about it said Gatsby politely I guess your friend Walter Chase wasnt too proud to come in on it And you left him in the lurch didnt you You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey God You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you He came to us dead broke He was very glad to pick up some money old sport Dont you call me old sport cried Tom Gatsby said nothing Walter could have you up on the betting laws too but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsbys face That drugstore business was just small change continued Tom slowly but youve got something on now that Walters afraid to tell me about I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin Then I turned back to Gatsbyand was startled at his expression He lookedand this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his gardenas if he had killed a man For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way It passed and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy denying everything defending his name against accusations that had not been made But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away trying to touch what was no longer tangible struggling unhappily undespairingly toward that lost voice across the room The voice begged again to go Please Tom I cant stand this any more Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions whatever courage she had had were definitely gone You two start on home Daisy said Tom In Mr Gatsbys car She looked at Tom alarmed now but he insisted with magnanimous scorn Go on He wont annoy you I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over They were gone without a word snapped out made accidental isolated like ghosts even from our pity After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whisky in the towel Want any of this stuff Jordan  Nick I didnt answer Nick He asked again What Want any No  I just remembered that todays my birthday I was thirty Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade It was seven oclock when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island Tom talked incessantly exulting and laughing but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead Human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind Thirtythe promise of a decade of loneliness a thinning list of single men to know a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm thinning hair But there was Jordan beside me who unlike Daisy was too wise ever to carry wellforgotten dreams from age to age As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coats shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight  The young Greek Michaelis who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest He had slept through the heat until after five when he strolled over to the garage and found George Wilson sick in his officereally sick pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over Michaelis advised him to go to bed but Wilson refused saying that hed miss a lot of business if he did While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead Ive got my wife locked in up there explained Wilson calmly Shes going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then were going to move away Michaelis was astonished they had been neighbours for four years and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement Generally he was one of these wornout men when he wasnt working he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable colourless way He was his wifes man and not his own So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened but Wilson wouldnt say a wordinstead he began to throw curious suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what hed been doing at certain times on certain days Just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away intending to come back later But he didnt He supposed he forgot to thats all When he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs Wilsons voice loud and scolding downstairs in the garage Beat me he heard her cry Throw me down and beat me you dirty little coward A moment later she rushed out into the dusk waving her hands and shoutingbefore he could move from his door the business was over The death car as the newspapers called it didnt stop it came out of the gathering darkness wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend Mavro Michaelis wasnt even sure of its colourhe told the first policeman that it was light green The other car the one going toward New York came to rest a hundred yards beyond and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson her life violently extinguished knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long  We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away Wreck said Tom Thats good Wilsonll have a little business at last He slowed down but still without any intention of stopping until as we came nearer the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes Well take a look he said doubtfully just a look I became aware now of a hollow wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words Oh my God uttered over and over in a gasping moan Theres some bad trouble here said Tom excitedly He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation it was a minute before I could see anything at all Then new arrivals deranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside Myrtle Wilsons body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a worktable by the wall and Tom with his back to us was bending over it motionless Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book At first I couldnt find the source of the high groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garagethen I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder but Wilson neither heard nor saw His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call Oh my Gaod Oh my Gaod Oh Gaod Oh my Gaod Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman Mav the policeman was saying o No r corrected the man Mavro Listen to me muttered Tom fiercely r said the policeman o g g He looked up as Toms broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder What you want fella What happenedthats what I want to know Auto hit her Insantly killed Instantly killed repeated Tom staring She ran out ina road Sonofabitch didnt even stopus car There was two cars said Michaelis one comin one goin see Going where asked the policeman keenly One goin each way Well shehis hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his sideshe ran out there an the one comin from NYork knock right into her goin thirty or forty miles an hour Whats the name of this place here demanded the officer Hasnt got any name A pale welldressed negro stepped near It was a yellow car he said big yellow car New See the accident asked the policeman No but the car passed me down the road going fastern forty Going fifty sixty Come here and lets have your name Look out now I want to get his name Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying in the office door for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries You dont have to tell me what kind of car it was I know what kind of car it was Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms Youve got to pull yourself together he said with soothing gruffness Wilsons eyes fell upon Tom he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright Listen said Tom shaking him a little I just got here a minute ago from New York I was bringing you that coupé weve been talking about That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasnt minedo you hear I havent seen it all afternoon Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes Whats all that he demanded Im a friend of his Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilsons body He says he knows the car that did it  It was a yellow car Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom And what colours your car Its a blue car a coupé Weve come straight from New York I said Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away Now if youll let me have that name again correct Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office set him down in a chair and came back If somebodyll come here and sit with him he snapped authoritatively He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step his eyes avoiding the table As he passed close to me he whispered Lets get out Selfconsciously with his authoritative arms breaking the way we pushed through the still gathering crowd passing a hurried doctor case in hand who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bendthen his foot came down hard and the coupé raced along through the night In a little while I heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face The God damned coward he whimpered He didnt even stop his car
